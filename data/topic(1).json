Statistics indicate that one in three women will be the victim of some type of violent attack in her lifetime. Women also endure more incidents of verbal and sexual harassment. Although\u00a0most women\u2019s self-defense courses focus on skills for quickly and efficiently destroying an attacker, self-defense training also should include methods for preventing a confrontation from turning physical in the first place. Learning how to steer away from a threat may not sound as exciting as ripping out an attacker\u2019s heart, but as they say in every beginner\u2019s class, evading an attack is almost always superior to blocking an attack. Here are a number of effective, real-life situation tested self-defense concepts and techniques that anyone can use. If you\u2019re an experienced martial artist, the physical techniques may appear familiar or even surprisingly basic, but that\u2019s fine. They\u2019re intended to be simple because in an assault, you\u2019ll experience fear and panic, along with a natural adrenaline rush. Despite the superhuman effects adrenaline can produce \u2014 we\u2019ve all heard stories about the grandmother who lifted a car off her trapped grandchild \u2014 it doesn\u2019t always work in your favor. You may experience tunnel vision, auditory exclusion and loss of fine motor skills. Consequently, it will be hard to see and hear, and complex martial arts techniques may be impossible to perform. If you stick with proven strategies and simple gross-motor-movement techniques \u2014 such as the 10 described here \u2014 your chance of surviving will increase drastically. 1. TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS Too many women enroll in a self-defense class after they\u2019ve been assaulted. When they recount the incident, they often say the same thing: \u201cI had this bad feeling, but I told myself not to be paranoid,\u201d or \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have gone, but I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.\u201d If something doesn\u2019t feel right, it probably isn\u2019t safe \u2014 that\u2019s the bottom line. Many women have been conditioned to ignore the little voice that tells them trouble is coming. Your instinct is the best detector of danger. The next time you hear that little voice, listen to what it\u2019s saying. 2. PRACTICE TARGET DENIAL Don\u2019t make yourself an accessible target. The outcome of a battle is often determined before the first blow is struck. When you have the opportunity to escape from a situation before it turns bad, take it. If an approaching person gives you the creeps, walk to the other side of the street. If an elevator door opens and the guy standing inside makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, wait for the next elevator. Those actions aren\u2019t cowardly; rather, they\u2019re a smart way to eliminate danger. 3. PRESENT YOURSELF WITH CONFIDENCE Be aware of the message your body sends to those around you. Like animals, human predators target those they consider the weakest or most vulnerable. Attackers search for women who appear frightened, confused or distracted. They look for women who walk with their head down and their hands stuffed in their pockets, or perhaps one who\u2019s overburdened with packages or distracted by children. Remember that attackers do not want to bait a fight; they want an easy mark. By walking with confidence and awareness \u2014 looking around and keeping your head up and shoulders back \u2014 you\u2019ll dramatically reduce the likelihood of becoming a target in the first place. 4. SET STRONG VERBAL BOUNDARIES Good verbal skills are an effective self-defense tool, one you\u2019re likely to use more frequently and successfully than any physical technique. When a predator engages you in conversation, he\u2019s actually \u201cinterviewing\u201d you to see if you\u2019ll make a good victim. An experienced attacker is practiced at using his words to freeze you with fear, thus reducing the chance that you\u2019ll try to defend yourself. Although an aggressive verbal confrontation can be terrifying, you have to be strong enough to show the attacker he\u2019s picked the wrong victim. If you stand tall, remain calm and respond confidently and assertively, you\u2019ll probably \u201cfail\u201d his interview. The power of your voice alone can cause him to seek an easier target. 5. MAINTAIN A NON-CONFRONTATIONAL STANCE In a self-defense situation, one of your secret weapons is the element of surprise. Most predators feel confident that you won\u2019t defend yourself, and you should capitalize on that misconception. If you assume a martial arts stance, it immediately tells the attacker that you know how to fight. In response, he\u2019s likely to be more aggressive. Instead, use a confident, relaxed stance in which your hips and shoulders are forward, your arms are bent, and your hands are up and open. This conciliatory posture may mislead the attacker into thinking you\u2019re willing to comply. If it becomes necessary for you to strike, he probably won\u2019t be prepared for it. 6. KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE Everyone has a comfort zone or personal space. When an aggressor enters that zone, you\u2019re uncomfortable because you know you\u2019d need that space if you had to fight back. When you\u2019re in an adrenalized state, you need a quarter of a second to react to an assault. This \u201creactionary gap\u201d should be anticipated when you think about your comfort zone. You should try to maintain approximately one to one-and-a-half arm lengths between yourself and the aggressor. If he starts closing in, you need to use verbal boundaries. If he still doesn\u2019t back off, it\u2019s time to get physical. 7. USE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE Most predators assume you cannot defend yourself. Therefore, you should take advantage of the element of surprise. If you\u2019re engaged in a conversation, you have the opportunity to use verbal skills and a non-confrontational stance to entice the aggressor into dropping his guard. If you\u2019re grabbed from behind, you must respond immediately. In either case, putting up a fight can surprise him and increase your chance of landing the first blow. 8. KEEP YOUR TECHNIQUES SIMPLE One of the main effects of an adrenaline release is the loss of fine motor skills. That means simple gestures such as unlacing your fingers or pulling your hands out of your pockets can become much more challenging. And the odds of your executing a beautiful joint lock or high kick rapidly dwindle. No matter which martial art you practice, learn techniques that are basic and stick with them in a selfdefense scenario. I recommend the following: \u2022 Heel-palm strike. Hitting with an open hand reduces the chance that you\u2019ll injure your hand and enables you to more easily attack from a nonconfrontational stance in which you\u2019re holding your hands up and open while you set verbal boundaries. Then, if your attacker steps into your comfort zone \u2014 bang! \u2014 he gets it right in the face. \u2022 Eye strike. The eye strike can be used in a standing or prone position. Often, simply driving your fingers toward your assailant\u2019s eyes will cause him to recoil. Even if you don\u2019t make contact, it creates space to set up a more devastating blow. \u2022 Knee strike. This technique is recommended over any type of standing kick because it is easy to use and can be delivered while you stay centered and close to the ground \u2014 which is crucial when you\u2019re adrenalized. A knee to the groin can end a fight immediately. 9. DON\u2019T PANIC IF YOU\u2019RE KNOCKED DOWN More often than not, women end up on the ground when they\u2019re assaulted. The good news is that most assailants are not skilled ground fighters; they\u2019re bullies who are used to knocking women down and forcing them to comply. Remember that the heel-palm strike and eye strike work well on the ground. It\u2019s a good idea to have a few kicks that work there, as well. In particular, the side thrust kick functions in a variety of scenarios. If you\u2019re on the ground and your assailant is standing, it gives you an advantage because your legs are longer than his arms. That means he\u2019ll have to expose his body to your kick if he wants to reach you. Knee strikes also function effectively on the ground. While you struggle with your attacker, he probably won\u2019t protect his groin. Once you see an opening, get close enough to strike upward into his crotch. 10. FOLLOW THROUGH The fight isn\u2019t over until the threat no longer exists. Therefore, you must be 110-percent committed to the battle. If you fight back and then pause, you give up the initial advantage you gained from using the element of surprise. Once your opponent knows you can fight, it becomes more difficult for you to prevail. To survive, you must continue your barrage until it\u2019s safe to stop striking and escape.

        "markdown": "Introduction: Basic Street Safety for Women By Follow More by the author: About: I'm an animation director by day and Queen of the monsters by night. I picked up most of my costume and prop building skills through hands on experimentation with materials. Experimentation led to addiction,\u2026 I have experienced two physical assaults in my life. The second was especially shaking and I have since become passionate about spreading solid self defense tips to the people around me. I may reference this incident as it is relevant to the Ible, but please know I am ok. My attacker got scared off and failed to do physical harm. This Ible focuses on preventing a physical incident in the first place, but also includes several very simple things you can do to make an attacker bail before they can do major harm. The main goal is for you to ESCAPE the attack and get help, not get into an epic street fight. Any self defense methods described here have been researched or gleaned from self defense workshops I have taken personally. Every situation will be different, so I'm tossing out a variety of information. Even if you never have to use it, knowing your options can help you feel more confident and in turn make you a less likely candidate for victimization. Step 1: Starters I'd like to begin with the simplest of suggestions: --Walk with a buddy whenever possible. Walking a few blocks home from a party? Making a quick trip to the pharmacy up the street? See if your spouse/ partner/ roommate/ neighbor can accompany you. You are automatically a less desirable target if you're not alone, and a little face to face social time doesn't hurt in the age of social media. --If you are walking alone at night, stay near well lit places of business and well lit walk ways. Avoid alleys and other poorly lit, closed spaces that might allow an attacker the advantage of surprise. --Trust your gut when parking your car. If you feel uneasy about where you've just parked, put it in drive and keep moving. Park as close as possible to your destination. Living in a very busy city, I know this is not always possible. If you must park farther away, look for well lit areas with lot of public foot traffic. If you're meeting friends, don't be ashamed of calling someone and asking them to walk you to/ from your vehicle. Step 2: Don't Be Distracted When walking alone, day or night, it is important to be alert. Don't be distracted. PUT. THE SMARTPHONE. DOWN! One of my attacks happened while I was talking on my phone. I was an easy target because I was focused on the conversation and not observing my surroundings.  A distracted person is an easy target. Just put the phone away. Your calls/ texts/ email/ social media can wait 10 more minutes. Messing with your phone means your eyes, mind, and hands are occupied. Your eyes should be watching where you are going and scanning your surroundings. Being observant of your surroundings can help you identify potential problems before you're in the middle of them, and identify exit routes, safe places to duck into, and allies on the street. Your mind/ ears should be free to take in the surroundings too, primarily sound. If I hadn't been on the phone, I may have heard foot steps approaching behind me. Be aware of footsteps, rustling bushes, approaching cars, or even arguing voices near by. Being aware is the first step to assessing whether the situation is a threat to your person. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy your iPod during your morning jog. Just be wise about when you choose to get lost in your music. Daylight walk along a residential street with traffic =OK! Night time walk home late from a party with low visibility and low traffic = Put away those earbuds! Your hands should be free so you can defend yourself, or prepared for an immediate act like unlocking your car. For example: Before you leave the inside of the mall, locate your car keys. Have them ready in hand as you walk through the parking lot to your car. This way you are ready to get in your car immediately, rather than standing around in the parking lot distracted as you rummage through the clutter of your bag. Lock your car immediately after you sit down in it. Step 3: Project Confidence When walking alone, walk with purpose and project confidence. Chin up, eyes forward, steady pace. Attackers are more likely to victimize someone who looks lost or timid. If you are not sure where you're going, JUST ACT LIKE YOU ARE. Keep moving and look confident. If you need to get your bearings (look up directions, call a friend, etc.) do not do this standing around on a street corner looking confused.  Predators will pick up on it and use this to their advantage, possibly offering you a ride or other assistance. If a stranger seems a little too insistent to help you, trust your gut and decline. Instead, look for an open place of business like a coffee shop or gas station and go inside. An attacker is far less likely to approach you inside a place of business, and an employee may be able to advise you on how to get where you need to go. This also gives you a safe opportunity to call a friend or a cab and stay inside until they arrive. Step 4: If You Feel (or Know) You Are Being Followed A good way to test is to cross the street at the next possible junction. If your tailgater follows you across, remain calm and identify your options. Scan the area for a business you can duck into. If an employee greets you upon entering, do not be afraid to fill them in on the situation. Calmly and clearly explain that you think you think someone may be following you, and you have come in because you fear for your safety and need a few minutes of refuge. Again, most people will be understanding and helpful as long as you are calm. Watch from a window to see what your follower does.  Most will just move on, because now you're no longer easy prey. If they linger outside as if waiting for you to emerge, call someone to come pick you up. The business owner may or may not ask them to leave the area, depending on how close they are to the private property. Do not leave the safety of the building until you are certain the follower has gone entirely, or until you have a buddy to escort you where you need to go. As you leave, it may be wise to change direction from your original walk. A smart assailant could be waiting further down the street, anticipating you will continue the same route. Do not be afraid what other people will think. I've had women tell me, \"oh I'd be nervous about ducking into a cafe to get directions or get away from someone. What if they think I'm silly/ stupid/ paranoid?\" A) Most people will not think these things and will be supportive in helping you feel safe. B) Who cares what they might think? If it's your safety vs. a stranger's opinion, you should always make your safety a priority. If you are in a residential neighborhood with no businesses to use as sanctuary: Scan the area for other pedestrians. Are there any joggers, dog walkers, or other folks on the street? If you truly feel in danger, do not be ashamed of approaching a stranger for assistance. Jog up to the lady dog walker and say 'Hi Nancy!\" as if you know her. When you get closer, quietly and calmly explain \"Hey, I know we don't know each other but that creep over there is following me. Can I please walk with you until he's gone?\" I have used this method multiple times, with both female and male pedestrians. Nobody has ever refused to help me. In fact, one guy enthusiastically held my hand and said loudly \"Hi sweetie! I've been waiting for you\" to make a creeper think he was my boyfriend. Your would-be assailant will be discouraged and move on if he sees you're part of a social unit, not solo. Step 5: Loud N' Proud Don't be afraid to be vocal. If someone is following you and making unwanted verbal contact (cat calls, harassment, etc.), make a scene that turns the discomfort on them, ultimately causing them to leave.This may be especially important if it is night time in a residential neighborhood. You need to get people looking out their windows or opening doors to see what's up. Stay in a well lit area so people can see you. Run up to somebody's porch and get under the porch light if you have to. If possible, get into a high visibility, public location as quickly as possible. Make sure other people can see you and your harasser clearly. Surround yourself with witnesses and potential allies. Say loudly and firmly \"I don't know this person and he/ she is harassing me.\" Don't shy away from using the simple phrase \"I need help.\" Your would-be assailant probably wasn't prepared to deal with an audience, and will usually abandon ship right there. If the creeper persists, either advancing toward you or making claims that they know you, repeat your declarations. Within any crowd there is at least one person who will recognize the situation for what it is. This person may choose to create a physical barrier between you and the harasser. They may also vocalize that the harasser is not welcome and should leave, or even suggest calling the police. Once you have someone else standing with you, it doesn't take much before a would-be assailant decides you aren't worth the trouble. Remain in the company of others until you are confident the harasser is gone. You may find yourself in a location where an audience is not readily available. Do not verbally engage the person harassing you unless they make a move to approach or you feel in immediate danger. If they start toward you, do not hesitate to scream and yell so that people in the area might hear you and look out their windows. Yell the phrases above, or make it very clear that contact isn't welcome with a firm, loud \"BACK OFF!\" or \"GO AWAY!\" Be firm. Commit and do not waver or sound unsure. I tend to throw in a few swear words for good measure, but that's just me. Assailants target people who they perceive will be weak in the moment and an easy take. Being loud and making a scene tells them you aren't going to go quietly. It throws them off their game and often causes them to abandon the mission. Some articles I've read have even suggested that acting really crazy is a good defense technique. Yell, wave your arms, run around, spit and foam at the mouth if you can muster it. Anything that draws attention to the incident and makes you look like too much for the assailant to handle gives you the advantage. Nobody wants to mess with crazy! Step 6: Discreet Self Defense Tools Notice that I call them \"tools\" not weapons. Two items I recommend here are things that I personally carry when walking alone. They are both very safe for the user and legal to carry in my state. Unless you invest the time in proper training to wield a knife or a gun (and know they are legal to carry in your state), I can't say I recommend those options for day to day self defense purposes. A knife in particular, can be easily fumbled or turned on a person with no experience. If you are willing to put in the time and effort for proper skill training with those weapons...hey, more power to ya'! Pepper Spray -- Relatively easy to find at places like hardware stores or sporting goods stores. I got mine at a True Value hardware. Go for the handheld size, not the giant bear repellent size you might buy for camping. Most models have a little safety cap above the trigger to make it near impossible to press the button on accident. An elastic band that you can slip over your hand is helpful, as it prevents the canister from being knocked out of your hand so easily. Use is pretty self explanatory. If an assailant comes at you, hold your arm out straight away from you and spray into the face. When contact is made and they're grabbing their eyes and screaming, you RUN! I keep this strapped to my hand from the moment I leave the apt. Remember, no fumbling in your purse in the middle of the street. Be ready! Self Defense Keychains -- This is something my boyfriend bought me after a really creepy encounter with two guys following me. You put your forefinger and middle finger through the eyes of the plastic cat and hold your keys in your fist. If you find yourself in a situation where you have to strike out, the firm plastic prongs deliver a major ouch to your assailant. Again, because it is linked to your hand it is much less likely to get wrestled away from you or turned against you. While the hope is that your attacker never even gets close enough for you to use this, I feel better carrying it just in case. The beauty of this tool is that it is very discreet and fits right on your keys. The time those two guys followed me, it was the middle of the day in a decent neighborhood. I had been visiting a friend and it never occurred to me that I'd want to bring pepper spray! Now I have something with me at all times that I don't have to make a special point of grabbing. *For items like this, check legality in your state. It's plastic, but some places may still construe it as a weapon somewhat along the line of brass knuckles. You may be able to carry it day to day on your person, but certainly don't expect it to get through anything like airline security. Spit -- Yes, spit. Your own spit can be used as a self defense tool if you're in a pinch. If you feel a confrontation is imminent, start conjuring up saliva in your mouth. If the person lunges at you, spit right at them --in the face if possible. You've just done something really unexpected. The surprise throws your attacker off his game, and maybe even grosses him out. If you're lucky, he's also distracted wiping spit out of his eyes. This disruption is your opportunity to RUN and yell for help. If he's smart, he won't pursue you. Leaving your spit also leaves your DNA behind. Should this be a case where the attacker is arrested and you need to prove he was the one who assaulted you, mention to police that you spit on him. They may be able to swab the person and retrieve traces, thus proving your account of the events. Step 7: If Someone Comes at You You don't have to be a martial arts expert to thwart an attack. Your assailant has a number of weak spots that you can take quick advantage of. Use any or all of these if you are grabbed. My self defense instructor put it to me this way: Wherever you are causing discomfort, that's where your attacker's mind goes. You want to get his mind off of his grip on you. Drawing his focus to other places increases your chances of breaking his grip. The goal is to disrupt the attack so you can break free and RUN. Eyes -- Gnarl your fingers into a claw hand. Grab, tear, and poke at the assailant's eyes. They will want to get your hands away from their face and will have to loosen their grip or adjust their hold to do so. This is when you break and run. Nose -- Another place where it really hurts to get hit. If you are not confident in delivering a straight on punch to the nose, try a forceful upward palm. If your hands are restrained, headbutt and smash the nose. Base of the Throat -- Feel that little dent between your clavicles? Press it with two fingers. Uncomfortable, yes? This is one of the most effective places to jab an attacker. With a firm, pointed hand, jab that dent at the base of the throat. Your attacker will be surprised and will be gasping/ coughing uncontrollably. Use the moment break and run if possible. If they're still holding on, continue to jab, poke, bite, kick, and scream. Their coughing will be throwing off their ability to hang on to you effectively. Fingers -- Bend them backwards, bite them, stomp on them, etc. Crotch -- It seems cliche and cartoonish, but a kick or knee to the crotch can definitely cause someone enough pain to let you get away. Shins -- 2 options here. Hard kicks to the shin or rake the bottom of your shoe down the front of the attacker's shin. The latter is more uncomfortable than you might think.  Shin raking, while more minor on the pain scale, is a good distraction technique that will allow you to get other effective moves in. Foot stomp -- Stomp with everything you've got. Anything you can do to throw off your attacker's balance is in your favor. They're unlikely to do a good job of holding on to you if they're falling over. You're also drawing focus well away from his grasp on you. One user suggested mentioning Acupressure Self Defense. This is not something I have first hand experience with, but I found to be a very clearly staged introduction to the topic. If the idea of acupressure self defense appeals to you, I encourage you to research further. Remember -- don't just watch videos. Practice with a partner and get a feel for the moves. Step 8: If You Are Grabbed From Behind You can't always see it coming, but you can react effectively once you realize it's happening. If your arms are free, thrust your elbows backward into the attacker's torso. An elbow makes a good strong point of contact. Foot stomps and Shin rakes are still solid options if you are grabbed from behind , and work even if your arms are pinned. If you are able, kick behind you, aiming for the attacker's knees . Bending their knee backwards will really hurt and you'll be throwing off their footing. Backwards head butt -- Another good one if your arms are pinned. Throw your head back with force. If height ratios are in your favor, the back of your head will crack the attacker right in the nose or teeth and cause a lot of pain. *effectiveness will vary if the attacker is dramatically taller or shorter than you. Bite -- Don't hesitate to use your teeth to chomp a hand that's trying to cover your face...or really anything else you don't want near you. Teeth are strong and can deliver some serious pain. The marks you leave may later serve as evidence or a way to identify your attacker to police. Try Something Unexpected -- This one is not necessarily a typical component of self defense, but I'm including it because it worked for me during my second assault. Your attacker is anticipating that you'll be trying to break out and away (the X axis, if you will), but may not be anticipating a vertical motion.  Try jumping up and down. It may vary the attacker's arm/ hand placement enough that you can get an out. You might also consider dropping low to duck out of their grasp (or get a good nut punch in). When my attacker grabbed me around the waist from behind, I elbowed backwards and then sat straight to the ground like dead weight. My attacker was not a very big guy, and when he realized he couldn't lift or pull me as dead weight, he just took off running. **I'm definitely not saying dropping to the ground is always the best idea or should be your first line of defense, but my situation proved that the unexpected can be exactly what you need to ruin an attacker's plan. When your safety is at stake, don't hesitate to try anything and everything. These are the simplest of weak spots and escape techniques I know. Learn them. Practice miming them with a friend to get the feel for them. It will help you feel more confident should the day come that you ever have to use them. I highly recommend that everyone (male and female) take an intro to self defense workshop at some time in their lives. There are many ways to manipulate an attacker's body and escape holds and chokes. My instructor taught me some great ones, but since I am not an expert I do not feel qualified to expand on them here. Please, don't wait for something bad to happen before you arm yourself with knowledge. Look into self defense classes in your area. Even a one time intro workshop can give you some invaluable tips. If any readers out there are in the Los Angeles area and are interested in a fantastic self defense workshop, send me a private message and I will hook you up with the awesome ( and very affordable) instructor I learned from. Step 9: The Aftermath You have escaped your attacker! Find a secure place and call the police immediately. Always file a report. Even if the attacker did not succeed in committing violence or sexual assault, if you experienced unwanted physical contact this is an \"assault\" and this IS a big deal! 9-1-1 is an appropriate number to call when you report an assault. It may take a while for police to show up to take your statement. I've waited anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, and that's in a urban area you'd think would have cops floating around. You may feel shaken and emotional. Do not hesitate to call a friend or knock on a neighbor's door and ask if they can sit with you until police arrive. Having nobody else near by, I knocked on the door of a neighbor with whom I had only ever exchanged simple \"hellos\" in the parking garage. He was extremely helpful and sympathetic, and I felt much better not being alone. People will surprise you with their kindness. Be clear when making your report and provide as much detail as you can. The police will ask you basics like gender, age, race, hair color, approximate height, and build. You may not know the attacker's actual height, but you can say things like \"a little taller than your partner\" and they can approximate for the report. When they ( I say \"they\" because police almost always respond in pairs) ask about clothing, try to recall colors, patterns, fabric types, type of shoes. Did you manage to rip or damage any clothing during the incident? Are there any other unique details you can recall? Think not just about sight, but also smell and sound. Did he smell strongly of anything in particular? Did he have any kid of accent when speaking? Something like this may set your attacker apart from other people of similar physical description. Tip: If find that you need to mime out parts of the attack to explain it clearly, 1) Tell the officers you're going to act it out before you start doing so. It will help them follow your story more clearly than if you just start waving arms around with no warning. 2) As best as possible, try to mime the actions on yourself. DO NOT demonstrate on the officer! I made the mistake of reaching out and grabbing an officer's arm to convey how I was grabbed (as you might do when explaining something to a friend). There was an immediate negative response. It hadn't occurred to me that there are rules about what is considered appropriate contact with an officer. In short, even if you happen to get wonderful, helpful officers, don't expect any comforting hugs. Step 10: Recovery and Moving Forward Recovery: During an attack, your adrenaline spikes big time. You may then experience an adrenal defecit in the days that follow. Expect to feel a little out of whack for at least the next day or two while your body recovers. You may feel so sleepy you can barely keep your head up, or still feel very shaken and emotional. I tried going to work the day after to feel \"normal\" and it just wasn't worth it. Stay home, if you feel safe there, or seek a relaxed environment or the company of a friend. Sleep. Avoid caffeine. Breathe deep, controlled breaths if you start to feel a panic attack. I found soothing scents like lavender, ginger, and peppermint very helpful in bringing my heart rate down when I felt anxious. These can be in the form of teas, essential oils applied to your temples, chest, or under the nose, or a dried herb aromatherapy sachet Like my Magensium, Vitamin C, E, and B6 are known to be helpful is supporting the adrenal glands and regulating stress hormones. If it helps to talk about what happened, find a friend who will listen. There's also no shame in calling a support hotline if you need an anonymous ear. Don't expect immediate results from your police report. Sometimes they catch the guy....sometimes not. Mine was never found. You need to do what helps you feel better and move forward with or without that victory. Inform the neighborhood. Decrease the chances that this will happen to someone else. In the days following my attack, I made flyers with his description and posted them in the surrounding area. I was unable to resist putting a little snark in mine, figuring my attacker was from the neighborhood and might see it. Neighborhood folks appreciated the heads up since they never would have expected it in our area. If your community has an online billboard, consider posting the information there too. Step 11: Stay Safe I really hope this Ible has provided some information that will help women out there feel confidently armed. Again, I really encourage everyone to get some self defense basics under your belt. You can google the moves and look at diagrams, but acting them out with an instructor or friend is really the best way to get comfortable with the material. Be proactive about safety. Learn how to help yourself, and how to react to situations in a way that helps others. Maybe you'll be the shop employee who gets approached for help, or the lady dog walker who pretends to know a stranger to keep her safe, or the policewoman who takes the report. If you are the survivor of an assault, know that there are so many resources available, both local to you and online, to help you deal with residual fear, depression, or panic attacks. Never be afraid to be honest about the lasting effect your event has had, and reach out. I've entered this Ible in the Safety Contest for visibility. Vote if you like, but more importantly please share this with the women in your life. That one new piece of information could be the one that helps them someday.

I just wanted to say that I loved this article!...My spouse is FEMA trained and we teach women's safety from the little known perspective of Situational Awareness rather than direct combat. I was pleased to see that many of the things we talk about were in this article as well and that you obviously have a passion for the topic. Very well done and keep up the good work! Reply 1 reply (author)7 years ago Thank you! I take this as a huge compliment. So glad the info checks out with official training. I have taken this topic to the next level by organizing womens' self defense classes locally, situational awareness and de-escalation techniques being a focus.

Reply 10 years ago Your art skillz are going to leave me with just a tee shirt aren't they? Nicely done. Reply 3 replies (author)10 years ago Ha! I don't think I'll get that lucky twice. These drawings are arguably less inspired, since it wasn't as light hearted a topic. I expect to be in the T-shirt club on this one, but that's ok. This is a subject i'm really passionate about and if it got a few people to look into self defense: mission accomplished. I read through yours yesterday and I keep thinking about those weird cookies. Chokies?? :) Reply 10 years ago I know. They are pretty common in the Philippines. Most of my family are lawyers so I took the pic initially to send to them (i.e. \"look at the perfect product to sue\"). You wouldn't believe the stuff they eat here. Last nite my fiancee and son chowed down on some snail soup. Arturo was crunching the shells and slurping up snails with the best of them. I LOVE to take pics like this. Used to post them all at \"safety graphic fun\" but julia stopped updating the site (it can still be viewed though). Reply 10 years ago I knew it! Congratulations. Well deserved. I just need to go to art school (and get reborn with some natural talent) and I will prevail eventually! I don't worry about self defense much; I'm 6'1\" and 220 when I am skinny.

Teach our sons that rape is wrong! Reply 10 years ago Very well done. Reply 1 reply (author)10 years ago Thanks, Bill! Reply 10 years ago You should really rename this, men are prone just as women so the distinction is something to outright get rid of. The most that make women more prone is the stigma that they are and other arbitrary things like that women carry bags that can easily be taken where most pants made for men have pockets that can fit water bottles in them and so is harder to mug. Other then that you give good advice, it's just the gendered edge that is something to make a point of because I want to feel better about leaving the house without feeling bad that I feel that way at all. Reply 2 replies (author)10 years ago As I told another commenter below, I agree with you 100% --attacks can happen to anyone! I geared the Ible mainly towards women because I find many are in need of encouragement to get educated about the subject of self defense, and women are perhaps less likely to pick up experience with physical fights through daily life (guys tend to grow up doing more play wrestling, etc). If you read the whole way through, you may have noticed I do recommend that everybody, male and female, take an intro to self defense course once in their lives. Reply 10 years ago Give it a rest! If you won't admit that most women are smaller, weigh less, and are not as physically strong as most men, you're not living in the real world! Reply 10 years ago This is great! Especially the part about simply staying alert. A basic firearms self=defense class I attended was taught by a police officer. He pointed out that cops in public are always in \"defense condition yellow,\" and the only time you should ever be in \"condition green\" is when you're at home with the doors locked. Ever notice that cops in a restaurant always sit with their backs to the wall, and usually where they can watch the door? That's defense condition yellow. Stay alert, stay alive! Reply 3 replies (author)10 years ago That makes total sense to me! The attack happened right around the corner from my apartment, where I clearly felt \"defense level green\" but should have been yellow. Reply 10 years ago Also, if one is worried about the \"cat\" on the keychain you mentioned getting you in trouble with the cops, A friend who used to live in NYC showed me the trick of carrying your keys with the keys sticking out between fingers. Keys by themselves are a pretty decent expedient defense \"tool.\" Hit someone with those and he'll have scratches and gouges, you'll have his DNA! Reply 10 years ago Cops always have to be on alert. Especially with groups like #BlackCrimesMatter openly calling to kill them. :^) Reply 10 years ago I give you an idea. if someone is stolen you and you are in a big city with a lot of people around you; scream HELP FIRE !!. The word FIRE is powerful; and everyone will look your situation. Reply 10 years ago Hi Ashley, This is an awesome article that everyone should read!!!. I giving a copy to my wife to read. I love the yellow follow-up warning sign. Voted!!! Reply 1 reply (author)10 years ago Thanks for passing the info on to your wife! I hope it helps her feel ready for anything! Reply 10 years ago Thank you for posting this, I hope it helps, and I'm glad you got the police to believe you - I personally would not count on it. My girlfriend was robbed and held hostage and made to go around to ATM's for 2 hours taking out money, when she escaped (an amazing story) and flagged down police they accused her of needing an excuse to tell her husband of why she was out at 2AM. Not until a woman was hurt by the same jerk did the police step in with an undercover woman cop and capture him. My friend has not worn a nice watch since that happened 10 years ago. I don't know how you ever get over that feeling of vulnerability. Reply 2 replies (author)10 years ago I'm really sorry your girlfriend went through that. I know what you mean. The police I dealt with after my first encounter were NOT sympathetic or helpful and the male officer kept trying to spin my words to make it sound like I was part of the problem. With all the news coverage we see these days of crooked cops using excessive force and manipulating words, I would not blame anyone for being hesitant to go to the police. Still, I think in almost all cases it is good to make a report. If you don't...what then? The attacker just gets away with it and there's no trace it ever happened? Even if the police don't respond as you might hope, that report does go into a pile and if they add up, eventually they should see a pattern and do something (as in your case with the undercover cop). Notice I say \"should\", as I have definitely experienced times when police just don't want to be bothered despite the evidence. I will also say I have dealt with some very decent, professional cops too. They are out there. It is too bad we even have to question that. Reply 10 years ago I would always urge anyone who is a victim of a crime or even an almost crime such as weird behavior, to go to the police. I just wanted to make sure that no one gets the wrong idea about my comment. It's vital to report crimes to the police, I meant that they are not always the most enlightened folks - until an actual really big crime takes place. You are so correct in saying that if you don't report it - what then? Who knows if the perp was practicing until he got it right? The pattern, or the reporting of what may become a pattern is vital to getting this person off of the streets. Reply 10 years ago My mom used to walk a lot in parks where there weren't many people around all the time. So she carried a roll of pennies in each hand. Advantages: 1. her hands were already fists, and 2. you can realy pack a wallop with re-enforced fists. She never needed to defend herself, but a good punch on the nose would leave a convincing impression! Reply 1 reply (author)10 years ago Well done on your mom's part for thinking to have something along. I'm glad she never had to use those pennies!

        "html": "Introduction: Basic Street Safety for Women By Follow More by the author: About: I'm an animation director by day and Queen of the monsters by night.  I picked up most of my costume and prop building skills through hands on experimentation with materials.  Experimentation led to addiction,\u2026 I have experienced two physical assaults in my life. The second was especially shaking and I have since become passionate about spreading solid self defense tips to the people around me. I may reference this incident as it is relevant to the Ible, but please know I am ok. My attacker got scared off and failed to do physical harm. This Ible focuses on preventing a physical incident in the first place, but also includes several very simple things you can do to make an attacker bail before they can do major harm. The main goal is for you to ESCAPE the attack and get help, not get into an epic street fight. Any self defense methods described here have been researched or gleaned from self defense workshops I have taken personally. Every situation will be different, so I'm tossing out a variety of information. Even if you never have to use it, knowing your options can help you feel more confident and in turn make you a less likely candidate for victimization. Step 1: Starters I'd like to begin with the simplest of suggestions: --Walk with a buddy whenever possible. Walking a few blocks home from a party? Making a quick trip to the pharmacy up the street?  See if your spouse/ partner/ roommate/ neighbor can accompany you. You are automatically a less desirable target if you're not alone, and a little face to face social time doesn't hurt in the age of social media. --If you are walking alone at night, stay near well lit places of business and well lit walk ways. Avoid alleys and other poorly lit, closed spaces that might allow an attacker the advantage of surprise. --Trust your gut when parking your car.  If you feel uneasy about where you've just parked, put it in drive and keep moving. Park as close as possible to your destination.  Living in a very busy city, I know this is not always possible. If you must park farther away, look for well lit areas with lot of public foot traffic.  If you're meeting friends, don't be ashamed of calling someone and asking them to walk you to/ from your vehicle. Step 2: Don't Be Distracted When walking alone, day or night, it is important to be alert.  Don't be distracted. PUT. THE SMARTPHONE. DOWN! One of my attacks happened while I was talking on my phone.  I was an easy target because I was focused on the conversation and not observing my surroundings. A distracted person is an easy target. Just put the phone away.  Your calls/ texts/ email/ social media can wait 10 more minutes. Messing with your phone means your eyes, mind, and hands are occupied. Your eyes should be watching where you are going and scanning your surroundings. Being observant of your surroundings can help you identify potential problems before you're in the middle of them, and identify exit routes, safe places to duck into, and allies on the street. Your mind/ ears should be free to take in the surroundings too, primarily sound. If I hadn't been on the phone, I may have heard foot steps approaching behind me. Be aware of footsteps, rustling bushes, approaching cars, or even arguing voices near by.  Being aware is the first step to assessing whether the situation is a threat to your person. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy your iPod during your morning jog. Just be wise about when you choose to get lost in your music. Daylight walk along a residential street with traffic =OK!  Night time walk home late from a party with low visibility and low traffic = Put away those earbuds! Your hands should be free so you can defend yourself, or prepared for an immediate act like unlocking your car. For example: Before you leave the inside of the mall, locate your car keys.  Have them ready in hand as you walk through the parking lot to your car.  This way you are ready to get in your car immediately, rather than standing around in the parking lot distracted as you rummage through the clutter of your bag. Lock your car immediately after you sit down in it. Step 3: Project Confidence When walking alone, walk with purpose and project confidence. Chin up, eyes forward, steady pace. Attackers are more likely to victimize someone who looks lost or timid. If you are not sure where you're going, JUST ACT LIKE YOU ARE. Keep moving and look confident. If you need to get your bearings (look up directions, call a friend, etc.) do not do this standing around on a street corner looking confused. Predators will pick up on it and use this to their advantage, possibly offering you a ride or other assistance. If a stranger seems a little too insistent to help you, trust your gut and decline. Instead, look for an open place of business like a coffee shop or gas station and go inside. An attacker is far less likely to approach you inside a place of business, and an employee may be able to advise you on how to get where you need to go.  This also gives you a safe opportunity to call a friend or a cab and stay inside until they arrive. Step 4: If You Feel (or Know) You Are Being Followed A good way to test is to cross the street at the next possible junction. If your tailgater follows you across, remain calm and identify your options. Scan the area for a business you can duck into.  If an employee greets you upon entering, do not be afraid to fill them in on the situation. Calmly and clearly explain that you think you think someone may be following you, and you have come in because you fear for your safety and need a few minutes of refuge. Again, most people will be understanding and helpful as long as you are calm. Watch from a window to see what your follower does. Most will just move on, because now you're no longer easy prey.  If they linger outside as if waiting for you to emerge, call someone to come pick you up.  The business owner may or may not ask them to leave the area, depending on how close they are to the private property. Do not leave the safety of the building until you are certain the follower has gone entirely, or until you have a buddy to escort you where you need to go. As you leave, it may be wise to change direction from your original walk.  A smart assailant could be waiting further down the street, anticipating you will continue the same route. Do not be afraid what other people will think. I've had women tell me, \"oh I'd be nervous about ducking into a cafe to get directions or  get away from someone.  What if they think I'm silly/ stupid/ paranoid?\"  A) Most people will not think these things and will be supportive in  helping you feel safe.  B) Who cares what they might think?  If it's  your safety vs. a stranger's opinion, you should always make your safety  a priority. If you are in a residential neighborhood with no businesses to use as sanctuary: Scan the area for other pedestrians. Are there any joggers, dog walkers, or other folks on the street? If you truly feel in danger, do not be ashamed of approaching a stranger for assistance. Jog up to the lady dog walker and say 'Hi Nancy!\" as if you know her.  When you get closer, quietly and calmly explain \"Hey, I know we don't know each other but that creep over there is following me.  Can I please walk with you until he's gone?\"  I have used this method multiple times, with both female and male pedestrians.  Nobody has ever refused to help me. In fact, one guy enthusiastically held my hand and said loudly \"Hi sweetie! I've been waiting for you\" to make a creeper think he was my boyfriend.  Your would-be assailant will be discouraged and move on if he sees you're part of a social unit, not solo. Step 5: Loud N' Proud Don't be afraid to be vocal. If someone is following you and making unwanted verbal contact (cat calls, harassment, etc.), make a scene that turns the discomfort on them, ultimately causing them to leave. This may be especially important if it is night time in a residential neighborhood.  You need to get people looking out their windows or opening doors to see what's up. Stay in a well lit area so people can see you. Run up to somebody's porch and get under the porch light if you have to. If possible, get into a high visibility, public location as quickly as possible. Make sure other people can see you and your harasser clearly. Surround yourself with witnesses and potential allies. Say loudly and firmly \"I don't know this person and he/ she is harassing me.\" Don't shy away from using the simple phrase \"I need help.\" Your would-be assailant probably wasn't prepared to deal with an audience, and will usually abandon ship right there. If the creeper persists, either advancing toward you or making claims that they know you, repeat your declarations. Within any crowd there is at least one person who will recognize the situation for what it is. This person may choose to create a physical barrier between you and the harasser.  They may also vocalize that the harasser is not welcome and should leave, or even suggest calling the police. Once you have someone else standing with you, it doesn't take much before a would-be assailant decides you aren't worth the trouble. Remain in the company of others until you are confident the harasser is gone. You may find yourself in a location where an audience is not readily available. Do not verbally engage the person harassing you unless they make a move to approach or you feel in immediate danger. If they start toward you, do not hesitate to scream and yell so that people in the area might hear you and look out their windows. Yell the phrases above, or make it very clear that contact isn't welcome with a firm, loud \"BACK OFF!\" or \"GO AWAY!\" Be firm.  Commit and do not waver or sound unsure. I tend to throw in a few swear words for good measure, but that's just me. Assailants target people who they perceive will be weak in the moment and an easy take. Being loud and making a scene tells them you aren't going to go quietly. It throws them off their game and often causes them to abandon the mission. Some articles I've read have even suggested that acting really crazy is a good defense technique. Yell, wave your arms, run around, spit and foam at the mouth if you can muster it. Anything that draws attention to the incident and makes you look like too much for the assailant to handle gives you the advantage. Nobody wants to mess with crazy! Step 6: Discreet Self Defense Tools Notice that I call them \"tools\" not weapons. Two items I recommend here are things that I personally carry when walking alone. They are both very safe for the user and legal to carry in my state. Unless you invest the time in proper training to wield a knife or a gun (and know they are legal to carry in your state), I can't say I recommend those options for day to day self defense purposes. A knife in particular, can be easily fumbled or turned on a person with no experience.  If you are willing to put in the time and effort for proper skill training with those weapons...hey, more power to ya'! Pepper Spray -- Relatively easy to find at places like hardware stores or sporting goods stores.  I got mine at a True Value hardware. Go for the handheld size, not the giant bear repellent size you might buy for camping. Most models have a little safety cap above the trigger to make it near impossible to press the button on accident. An elastic band that you can slip over your hand is helpful, as it prevents the canister from being knocked out of your hand so easily. Use is pretty self explanatory. If an assailant comes at you, hold your arm out straight away from you and spray into the face. When contact is made and they're grabbing their eyes and screaming, you RUN! I keep this strapped to my hand from the moment I leave the apt. Remember, no fumbling in your purse in the middle of the street.  Be ready! Self Defense Keychains -- This is something my boyfriend bought me after a really creepy encounter with two guys following me. You put your forefinger and middle finger through the eyes of the plastic cat and hold your keys in your fist. If you find yourself in a situation where you have to strike out, the firm plastic prongs deliver a major ouch to your assailant. Again, because it is linked to your hand it is much less likely to get wrestled away from you or turned against you. While the hope is that your attacker never even gets close enough for you to use this, I feel better carrying it just in case. The beauty of this tool is that it is very discreet and fits right on your keys.  The time those two guys followed me, it was the middle of the day in a decent neighborhood.  I had been visiting a friend and it never occurred to me that I'd want to bring pepper spray!  Now I have something with me at all times that I don't have to make a special point of grabbing. *For items like this, check legality in your state.  It's plastic, but some places may still construe it as a weapon somewhat along the line of brass knuckles. You may be able to carry it day to day on your person, but certainly don't expect it to get through anything like airline security. Spit -- Yes, spit.  Your own spit can be used as a self defense tool if you're in a pinch. If you feel a confrontation is imminent, start conjuring up saliva in your mouth.  If the person lunges at you, spit right at them --in the face if possible. You've just done something really unexpected. The surprise throws your attacker off his game, and maybe even grosses him out. If you're lucky, he's also distracted wiping spit out of his eyes. This disruption is your opportunity to RUN and yell for help. If he's smart, he won't pursue you. Leaving your spit also leaves your DNA behind. Should this be a case where the attacker is arrested and you need to prove he was the one who assaulted you, mention to police that you spit on him.  They may be able to swab the person and retrieve traces, thus proving your account of the events. Step 7: If Someone Comes at You You don't have to be a martial arts expert to thwart an attack.  Your assailant has a number of weak spots that you can take quick advantage of. Use any or all of these if you are grabbed. My self defense instructor put it to me this way: Wherever you are causing discomfort, that's where your attacker's mind goes. You want to get his mind off of his grip on you. Drawing his focus to other places increases your chances of breaking his grip. The goal is to disrupt the attack so you can break free and RUN. Eyes -- Gnarl your fingers into a claw hand. Grab, tear, and poke at the assailant's eyes. They will want to get your hands away from their face and will have to loosen their grip or adjust their hold to do so.  This is when you break and run. Nose -- Another place where it really hurts to get hit. If you are not confident in delivering a straight on punch to the nose, try a forceful upward palm. If your hands are restrained, headbutt and smash the nose. Base of the Throat -- Feel that little dent between your clavicles? Press it with two fingers.  Uncomfortable, yes? This is one of the most effective places to jab an attacker. With a firm, pointed hand, jab that dent at the base of the throat. Your attacker will be surprised and will be gasping/ coughing uncontrollably. Use the moment break and run if possible. If they're still holding on, continue to jab, poke, bite, kick, and scream. Their coughing will be throwing off their ability to hang on to you effectively. Fingers -- Bend them backwards, bite them, stomp on them, etc. Crotch -- It seems cliche and cartoonish, but a kick or knee to the crotch can definitely cause someone enough pain to let you get away. Shins -- 2 options here. Hard kicks to the shin or rake the bottom of your shoe down the front of the attacker's shin. The latter is more uncomfortable than you might think. Shin raking, while more minor on the pain scale, is a good distraction technique that will allow you to get other effective moves in. Foot stomp -- Stomp with everything you've got. Anything you can do to throw off your attacker's balance is in your favor.  They're unlikely to do a good job of holding on to you if they're falling over. You're also drawing focus well away from his grasp on you. One user suggested mentioning Acupressure Self Defense. This is not something I have first hand experience with, but I found to be a very clearly staged introduction to the topic. If the idea of acupressure self defense appeals to you, I encourage you to research further. Remember -- don't just watch videos. Practice with a  partner and get a feel for the moves. Step 8: If You Are Grabbed From Behind You can't always see it coming, but you can react effectively once you realize it's happening. If your arms are free, thrust your elbows backward into the attacker's torso. An elbow makes a good strong point of contact. Foot stomps and Shin rakes are still solid options if you are grabbed from behind , and work even if your arms are pinned. If you are able, kick behind you, aiming for the attacker's knees .  Bending their knee backwards will really hurt and you'll be throwing off their footing. Backwards head butt -- Another good one if your arms are pinned. Throw your head back with force.  If height ratios are in your favor, the back of your head will crack the attacker right in the nose or teeth and cause a lot of pain. *effectiveness will vary if the attacker is dramatically taller or shorter than you. Bite -- Don't hesitate to use your teeth to chomp a hand that's trying to cover your face...or really anything else you don't want near you.  Teeth are strong and can deliver some serious pain. The marks you leave may later serve as evidence or a way to identify your attacker to police. Try Something Unexpected -- This one is not necessarily a typical component of self defense, but I'm including it because it worked for me during my second assault. Your attacker is anticipating that you'll be trying to break out and away (the X axis, if you will), but may not be anticipating a vertical motion. Try jumping up and down. It may vary the attacker's arm/ hand placement enough that you can get an out. You might also consider dropping low to duck out of their grasp (or get a good nut punch in). When my attacker grabbed me around the waist from behind, I elbowed backwards and then sat straight to the ground like dead weight. My attacker was not a very big guy, and when he realized he couldn't lift or pull me as dead weight, he just took off running. **I'm definitely not saying dropping to the ground is always the best idea or should be your first line of defense, but my situation proved that the unexpected can be exactly what you need to ruin an attacker's plan. When your safety is at stake, don't hesitate to try anything and everything. These are the simplest of weak spots and escape techniques I know. Learn them. Practice miming them with a friend to get the feel for them. It will help you feel more confident should the day come that you ever have to use them. I highly recommend that everyone (male and female) take an intro to self defense workshop at some time in their lives. There are many ways to manipulate an attacker's body and escape holds and chokes. My instructor taught me some great ones, but since I am not an expert I do not feel qualified to expand on them here. Please, don't wait for something bad to happen before you arm yourself with knowledge.  Look into self defense classes in your area. Even a one time intro workshop can give you some invaluable tips. If any readers out there are in the Los Angeles area and are interested in a fantastic self defense workshop, send me a private message and I will hook you up with the awesome ( and very affordable) instructor I learned from. Step 9: The Aftermath You have escaped your attacker! Find a secure place and call the police immediately.  Always file a report. Even if the attacker did not succeed in committing violence or sexual assault, if you experienced unwanted physical contact this is an \"assault\" and this IS a big deal! 9-1-1 is an appropriate number to call when you report an assault. It may take a while for police to show up to take your statement. I've waited anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, and that's in a urban area you'd think would have cops floating around. You may feel shaken and emotional. Do not hesitate to call a friend or knock on a neighbor's door and ask if they can sit with you until police arrive. Having nobody else near by, I knocked on the door of a neighbor with whom I had only ever exchanged simple \"hellos\" in the parking garage. He was extremely helpful and sympathetic, and I felt much better not being alone. People will surprise you with their kindness. Be clear when making your report and provide as much detail as you can. The police will ask you basics like gender, age, race, hair color, approximate height, and build.  You may not know the attacker's actual height, but you can say things like \"a little taller than your partner\" and they can approximate for the report. When they ( I say \"they\" because police almost always respond in pairs) ask about clothing, try to recall colors, patterns, fabric types, type of shoes. Did you manage to rip or damage any clothing during the incident? Are there any other unique details you can recall? Think not just about sight, but also smell and sound. Did he smell strongly of anything in particular? Did he have any kid of accent when speaking? Something like this may set your attacker apart from other people of similar physical description. Tip: If find that you need to mime out parts of the attack to explain it clearly, 1) Tell the officers you're going to act it out before you start doing so. It will help them follow your story more clearly than if you just start waving arms around with no warning. 2) As best as possible, try to mime the actions on yourself.  DO NOT demonstrate on the officer! I made the mistake of reaching out and grabbing an officer's arm to convey how I was grabbed (as you might do when explaining something to a friend).  There was an immediate negative response. It hadn't occurred to me that there are rules about what is considered appropriate contact with an officer.  In short, even if you happen to get wonderful, helpful officers, don't expect any comforting hugs. Step 10: Recovery and Moving Forward Recovery: During an attack, your adrenaline spikes big time. You may then experience an adrenal defecit in the days that follow. Expect to feel a little out of whack for at least the next day or two while your body recovers. You may feel so sleepy you can barely keep your head up, or still feel very shaken and emotional. I tried going to work the day after to feel \"normal\" and it just wasn't worth it. Stay home, if you feel safe there, or seek a relaxed environment or the company of a friend. Sleep. Avoid caffeine. Breathe deep, controlled breaths if you start to feel a panic attack. I found soothing scents like lavender, ginger, and peppermint very helpful in bringing my heart rate down when I felt anxious. These can be in the form of teas, essential oils applied to your temples, chest, or under the nose, or a dried herb aromatherapy sachet Like my Magensium, Vitamin C, E, and B6 are known to be helpful is supporting the adrenal glands and regulating stress hormones. If it helps to talk about what happened, find a friend who will listen. There's also no shame in calling a support hotline if you need an anonymous ear. Don't expect immediate results from your police report. Sometimes they catch the guy....sometimes not. Mine was never found. You need to do what helps you feel better and move forward with or without that victory. Inform the neighborhood. Decrease the chances that this will happen to someone else. In the days following my attack, I made flyers with his description and posted them in the surrounding area. I was unable to resist putting a little snark in mine, figuring my attacker was from the neighborhood and might see it. Neighborhood folks appreciated the heads up since they never would have expected it in our area. If your community has an online billboard, consider posting the information there too. Step 11: Stay Safe I really hope this Ible has provided some information that will help women out there feel confidently armed. Again, I really encourage everyone to get some self defense basics under your belt. You can google the moves and look at diagrams, but acting them out with an instructor or friend is really the best way to get comfortable with the material. Be proactive about safety. Learn how to help yourself, and how to react to situations in a way that helps others. Maybe you'll be the shop employee who gets approached for help, or the lady dog walker who pretends to know a stranger to keep her safe, or the policewoman who takes the report. If you are the survivor of an assault, know that there are so many resources available, both local to you and online, to help you deal with residual fear, depression, or panic attacks. Never be afraid to be honest about the lasting effect your event has had, and reach out. I've entered this Ible in the Safety Contest for visibility. Vote if you like, but more importantly please share this with the women in your life. That one new piece of information could be the one that helps them someday.

I just wanted to say that I loved this article!...My spouse is FEMA trained and we teach women's safety from the little known perspective of Situational Awareness rather than direct combat. I was pleased to see that many of the things we talk about were in this article as well and that you obviously have a passion for the topic. Very well done and keep up the good work! Reply 1 reply (author) 7 years ago Thank you!  I take this as a huge compliment. So glad the info checks out with official training. I have taken this topic to the next level by organizing womens' self defense classes locally, situational awareness and de-escalation techniques being a focus.

These drawings are arguably less inspired, since it wasn't as light hearted a topic. I expect to be in the T-shirt club on this one, but that's ok. This is a subject i'm really passionate about and if it got a few people to look into self defense: mission accomplished. I read through yours yesterday and I keep thinking about those weird cookies.  Chokies?? :) Reply 10 years ago I know.   They are pretty common in the Philippines.  Most of my family are lawyers so I took the pic initially to send to them (i.e. \"look at the perfect product to sue\").  You wouldn't believe the stuff they eat here.  Last nite my fiancee and son chowed down on some snail soup.   Arturo was crunching the shells and slurping up snails with the best of them. I LOVE to take pics like this.  Used to post them all at \"safety graphic fun\" but julia stopped updating the site (it can still be viewed though). Reply 10 years ago I knew it!   Congratulations.  Well deserved.  I just need to go to art school (and get reborn with some natural talent) and I will prevail eventually! I don't worry about self defense much; I'm 6'1\" and 220 when I am skinny.

Teach our sons that rape is wrong! Reply 10 years ago Very well done. Reply 1 reply (author) 10 years ago Thanks, Bill! Reply 10 years ago You should really rename this, men are prone just as women so the distinction is something to outright get rid of. The most that make women more prone is the stigma that they are and other arbitrary things like that women carry bags that can easily be taken where most pants made for men have pockets that can fit water bottles in them and so is harder to mug. Other then that you give good advice, it's just the gendered edge that is something to make a point of because I want to feel better about leaving the house without feeling bad that I feel that way at all. Reply 2 replies (author) 10 years ago As I told another commenter below, I agree with you 100% --attacks can happen to anyone! I geared the Ible mainly towards women because I find many are in need of encouragement to get educated about the subject of self defense, and women are perhaps less likely to pick up experience with physical fights through daily life (guys tend to grow up doing more play wrestling, etc). If you read the whole way through, you may have noticed I do recommend that everybody, male and female, take an intro to self defense course once in their lives. Reply 10 years ago Give it a rest! If you won't admit that most women are smaller, weigh less, and are not as physically strong as most men, you're not living in the real world! Reply 10 years ago This is great! Especially the part about simply staying alert. A basic firearms self=defense class I attended was taught by a police officer. He pointed out that cops in public are always in \"defense condition yellow,\" and the only time you should ever be in \"condition green\" is when you're at home with the doors locked. Ever notice that cops in a restaurant always sit with their backs to the wall, and usually where they can watch the door? That's defense condition yellow. Stay alert, stay alive! Reply 3 replies (author) 10 years ago That makes total sense to me!  The attack happened right around the corner from my apartment, where I clearly felt \"defense level green\" but should have been yellow. Reply 10 years ago Also, if one is worried about the \"cat\" on the keychain you mentioned getting you in trouble with the cops, A friend who used to live in NYC showed me the trick of carrying your keys with the keys sticking out between fingers. Keys by themselves are a pretty decent expedient defense \"tool.\" Hit someone with those and he'll have scratches and gouges, you'll have his DNA! Reply 10 years ago Cops always have to be on alert. Especially with groups like #BlackCrimesMatter openly calling to kill them.  :^) Reply 10 years ago I give you an idea. if someone is stolen you and you are in a big city with a lot of people around you; scream HELP FIRE !!. The word FIRE is powerful; and everyone will look your situation. Reply 10 years ago Hi Ashley, This is an awesome article that everyone should read!!!. I giving a copy to my wife to read. I love the yellow follow-up warning sign. Voted!!! Reply 1 reply (author) 10 years ago Thanks for passing the info on to your wife! I hope it helps her feel ready for anything! Reply 10 years ago Thank you for posting this, I hope it helps, and I'm glad you got the police to believe you - I personally would not count on it. My girlfriend was robbed and held hostage and made to go around to ATM's for 2 hours taking out money, when she escaped (an amazing story) and flagged down police they accused her of needing an excuse to tell her husband of why she was out at 2AM. Not until a woman was hurt by the same jerk did the police step in with an undercover woman cop and capture him. My friend has not worn a nice watch since that happened 10 years ago. I don't know how you ever get over that feeling of vulnerability. Reply 2 replies (author) 10 years ago I'm really sorry your girlfriend went through that. I know what you mean.  The police I dealt with after my first encounter were NOT sympathetic or helpful and the male officer kept trying to spin my words to make it sound like I was part of the problem.  With all the news coverage we see these days of crooked cops using excessive force and manipulating words, I would not blame anyone for being hesitant to go to the police. Still, I think in almost all cases it is good to make a report. If you don't...what then?  The attacker just gets away with it and there's no trace it ever happened? Even if the police don't respond as you might hope, that report does go into a pile and if they add up, eventually they should see a pattern and do something (as in your case with the undercover cop). Notice I say \"should\", as I have definitely experienced times when police just don't want to be bothered despite the evidence.  I will also say I have dealt with some very decent, professional cops too. They are out there. It is too bad we even have to question that. Reply 10 years ago I would always urge anyone who is a victim of a crime or even an almost crime such as weird behavior, to go to the police. I just wanted to make sure that no one gets the wrong idea about my comment. It's vital to report crimes to the police, I meant that they are not always the most enlightened folks - until an actual really big crime takes place. You are so correct in saying that if you don't report it - what then? Who knows if the perp was practicing until he got it right? The pattern, or the reporting of what may become a pattern is vital to getting this person off of the streets. Reply 10 years ago My mom used to walk a lot in parks where there weren't many people around all the time. So she carried a roll of pennies in each hand.  Advantages: 1. her hands were already fists, and 2. you can realy pack a wallop with re-enforced fists.  She never needed to defend herself, but a good punch on the nose would leave a convincing impression! Reply 1 reply (author) 10 years ago Well done on your mom's part for thinking to have something along.  I'm glad she never had to use those pennies!

There are many occasions when you aren\u2019t physically present with your child, be it school or co-curricular activities. During such events there exists a possibility of danger to your child in the form of bullying or something even worse. Hence children must know how to defend themselves. Self-defence is a valuable skill that protects and even raises confidence in your child. Here are some of the top self-defence techniques you need to teach your child. 2 /7 \u200bAttack on sensitive places Knowing where to hit is the most critical step in learning self-defence. The offensive and defensive strategies only are effective if the adversary is hit at the right spot. In the beginning try to keep things simple, so that your kid easily learns to target the knees, groyne, and head. You can teach them knee strikes are particularly impactful since they are difficult to block. They should know how to target the attacker's neck, eyes, ears, and nose as a part of self-defence. 3 /7 \u200bStrong fist Although it may appear to be an easy thing, many people including adults too are unaware of how to build a proper and effective fist. While making a fist, do remember to tightly curl your four fingers before wrapping the thumb around them from outside to inflict pain. A sloppy fist can wind up inflicting greater damage on the puncher. When your kid makes contact with the culprit, a correct fist will help to prevent the child from injuring his thumb. 4 /7 \u200bAttacking posture The correct attacking posture indicates both confidence and a refusal to surrender. Teach your child how to face the attacker with one foot forward. This stance aids the child to be at a stable equilibrium. While being at this stance the child should then raise his fists accompanied with a violent yell. This posture indicates that the child is prepared for a fight and is not a simple target. The bully is likely to flee as a result of the move. 5 /7 \u200bFrequent punching When confronted with a threat, most people immediately desire to punch the perpetrator. While landing a heavy punch can be effective, it will only succeed if the attacker is not prepared to stop it. A more potent manoeuvre is a direct punch. One punch may not be sufficient, especially if the adversary can recuperate. The child should hit and continue striking with his hands in a fist as if he were beating a drum. If the evil guy is attempting to grasp the child's hands, he should aim for the arms. It might be confusing to be repeatedly smacked in the chest and face. Even if it's from a toddler, a thud on the nose will still elicit tears. 6 /7 Foot attack You can educate your child on how to pose a danger with his/her legs. The predator will automatically be hurt or at least slowed down if you stomp on or kick him. Even if the child is against a larger opponent, this knee strike method can be performed. Before kicking down with the heel of the foot, one should pull up the knee to cause discomfort and stop the attacker from moving. Such a technique can also be used to set up a punching opportunity as well. 7 /7 \u200bBody language Many individuals mistake self-defence for fighting or retaliation. Self-defence, in reality, involves more than just fighting. It\u2019s essentially about being aware of your surroundings and being self-assured. Children who develop confidence hold themselves in such a way that bullies are naturally kept at bay. Teach your child to trust his/her instincts and to be alert and aware of his/her surroundings at all times. Teach them how to be forceful and speak with authority. A confident and high self-esteem personality can naturally keep oneself away from the dangers.

The U.S. State Department\u2019s Colombia advisory shows how being aware can prevent danger. Practice noticing details: what sounds, movements, or behaviors seem odd? Trust your gut\u2014it\u2019s your internal warning system. Overcoming Fear and Panic Use voice: A firm \u201cstop\u201d or loud scream can give you 2\u20134 seconds to get away.

Remember: Target joints or nerve clusters for quick effects. Less force is needed when striking pressure points. Tools like the Defender Ring enhance precision without requiring brute strength. Legal Considerations When Applying Defensive Force Always ensure your response aligns with legal standards. Below are key principles to remember: | Legal Principle | Explanation | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reasonable Force | Only enough to stop the threat | A palm strike to the nose to create distance |\n| Duty to Retreat | Escaping before using force if safe | Backing away before targeting the throat |\n| Proportionality | Force matches the threat level | Eye strike against a non-lethal attacker | Escaping Grabs and Holds: Breaking Free More than 70% of self-defense situations involve grappling.

Using Everyday Objects as Self-Defense Tools When seconds count, everyday items can become powerful tools in self-protection methods . A sturdy umbrella, a keychain, or even your phone can turn the tide in a dangerous situation. Let\u2019s explore how to adapt these items for practical self-defense techniques . Improvised Weapons for Emergency Situations Carry objects designed to surprise attackers. The Unbreakable\u00ae Umbrella , for instance, offers bone-crunching force with less precision needed than regular umbrellas. Here\u2019s how to use common items effectively: Umbrellas: Thrust toward the attacker\u2019s face or ribs. Rotate the shaft like a bat to maximize impact. Keys: Wrap fingers around a keychain for a close-quarters punch. Aim for eyes, throat, or hands to disable grip. Phones: Throw as a distraction or strike at an attacker\u2019s shins. Heavier models work best. Keychain and Personal Accessories Small items can make big differences. Consider these options: Tool Use Key Features Unbreakable\u00ae Keychain Quick strikes to joints or pressure points Reinforced steel core resists bending Personal Alarm Startle response to draw attention 120+ decibel siren, pocket-sized Defensive Applications of Common Items Practice using items in five strike directions zones: upward (chin), downward (nose), left/right (ears), and straight (chest). Always prioritize escape after creating distance. Remember: Mental readiness matters more than physical strength. Krav Maga teaches using objects as extensions of your arms\u2014train daily to recognize opportunities. Legal limits vary by state, so know your local self-defense laws before relying on these methods. Verbal De-escalation: Self-Defense Without Physical Contact Verbal de-escalation is key for safety awareness tips everyone needs. In 9 out of 10 conflicts, calm talk can stop violence. Learn the 4 A\u2019s to reduce tension: Apologize sincerely, even if you\u2019re not at fault. This instantly lowers aggression. Acknowledge the other person\u2019s feelings to build trust.

SCARS data shows proper techniques can multiply your force by 3x against attackers. Stay consistent\u2014your safety depends on it. Self-Defense Strategies for Specific Scenarios Effective personal safety strategies vary by situation. Prepare for common threats like home invasions, street encounters, and vehicle risks. Learn how to protect yourself in these situations. Home Invasions: Avoid confrontation if an intruder enters. Make loud noises to attract attention and find a secure room. Remember, a locked door can slow intruders down, as they often look for easy entry points. Public Spaces: Be alert in crowded areas. If someone approaches aggressively, create distance right away. A palm strike to the nose or eyes can upset an attacker\u2019s balance, giving you time to escape. Vehicle Threats: Lock your doors when parked. If someone tries to approach you while stopped, keep windows closed and drive away if you can. Always have keys ready for your car\u2019s alarm system. Confrontations: Use strong verbal commands like \u201cStop!\u201d Firmly. If you must use physical force, aim for weak spots like the eyes, throat, or knees to temporarily disable the attacker. Look at real-life examples: Joe Torrez, a martial artist, fought off four attackers with simple elbow strikes and escapes. Training in basic skills like palm strikes is more effective under stress than complex moves. Always aim to escape first, fight only if you have no choice. Regular practice of these self-protection methods improves your chances of survival. Stay alert and prepared.

        "markdown": "Basic Self-Defense by \\| Jan 18, 2024 Self-defense involves techniques, strategies, and physical skills to recognize and protect yourself against danger. At its core, this discipline has the potential to empower anyone willing to learn and practice. Developing basic self-defense skills gives you a sense of confidence, knowing that you can protect yourself and not have to wait for someone else to save the day. The extra few seconds you gain by fending off an attacker could save your life. Below, learn the fundamentals of self-defense and explore other ways to keep yourself and your home as safe as possible. Types of Self-Defense Specific techniques can vary depending on the situation and level of danger. The following types of self-defense are widely considered effective ways to protect yourself and others. As you go down the list, the methods are more advanced or intense in response to higher threat levels. Non-Physical Techniques : These techniques focus on defusing or avoiding a dangerous situation through communication and decision-making rather than physical force. Physical Techniques : These involve using the body\u2019s natural abilities and physical force to defend oneself. Examples include striking techniques, joint locks, and ground fighting moves, like what you\u2019d see in martial arts. Non-Lethal Weapons: These include items like pepper spray, tasers, and stun guns that can temporarily disable an attacker without causing permanent harm. Lethal Weapons :\u00a0 This refers to the potentially deadly \u201ctools\u201d of self-defense, such as knives and firearms. It is important to note that the use of lethal force should only be considered in life-threatening situations and with proper training. In general, you\u2019ll want to stop at the level that\u2019s appropriate to your situation. (There\u2019s no need to pull out a taser if a simple conversation will do the trick.) This can involve a split-second judgment call, which is why it\u2019s so important to learn about the full spectrum of responsible self-defense in a controlled environment. An Important Note: Using Deadly ForceTitle The fundamental purpose of self-defense is to eliminate a threat to yourself or others. In a small percentage of situations, this may call for using deadly force. Before you commit to learning how to use deadly force, you must understand the legal implications.\u00a0Someone may only use deadly force when there is an immediate and unavoidable danger of death or great bodily harm to an innocent person, where no other defense option exists. This also begs the question: when confronted with a threat, how do you know whether to run, hide, or fight? The best possible solution, both practically and legally, is to retreat if at all possible. Hiding can be a valid strategy, too. However, if neither of those is an option, or if a loved one is in imminent danger, you may need to use force\u2014even deadly force, if you\u2019re mentally and physically prepared to do so. Ideally, it will never come to this difficult decision. Fortifying your home is one way you can prevent a deadly conflict. To that end, we\u2019re including a few basic home security tips near the end of this guide. Basic Self-Defense Tools and Tactics Let\u2019s walk through each type of self-defense and the broad strokes you should know to keep yourself safe. Learn as much as you need to feel comfortable protecting yourself and your family. Non-Physical Techniques In some situations, you can avoid a physical conflict altogether. Assess each situation carefully and choose the best course of action to ensure your safety. Learning to avoid confrontation is an acquired skill all of its own. Avoiding Dangerous Situations The best way to protect yourself is to avoid dangerous situations altogether. This is primarily a function of forethought. Make a habit of planning for \u201cworst-case scenarios.\u201d This is especially important when you\u2019re out of your normal routine, such as on vacation or during major weather events. Keep a pulse on social or civil unrest present in your area. Read the news. Familiarize yourself with crime rates in your area. When you know what harm could befall you, it\u2019s easier to stay out of harm\u2019s way. It\u2019s also important to be cautious on social media and not share personal information that could make you vulnerable to potential harm. Situational Awareness Being aware of your surroundings, recognizing warning signs, and having a plan of action are cornerstones of being fully prepared to defend yourself. These essential skills are what all other self-defense techniques rely upon. Practicing situational awareness means being present in the moment and paying attention to things around you. This includes: Observing People : Pay attention to people\u2019s body language, facial expressions, and actions. This can help identify potential threats or dangerous situations. Assessing Environments : Look for potential exit routes, safe hiding spots, or objects that can be used for protection. Being Aware of Personal Items : Keep personal items such as wallets, phones, and keys secure and within reach to avoid being caught off guard. Avoiding Dangerous or Isolated Areas : When possible, avoid walking alone in poorly lit or isolated areas. Stick to well-lit, populated routes whenever possible. Trusting Your Intuition : If something feels off or unsafe, trust your gut. It\u2019s often right. By practicing situational awareness, you can avoid threats altogether, or at least have a better chance of protecting yourself. This skill is particularly important if you often find yourself in high-risk environments such as public transportation, crowded events, or traveling alone. Running and Evasion Another alternative to physical confrontation is using strategies to escape or evade a potential threat. This can include running away, finding a hidden location like a safe room in your home, and calling for help. If you exercise regularly, work sprints, jumps, and climbing maneuvers into your fitness routine. De-escalation Verbal de-escalation is the use of communication techniques to defuse a potentially violent situation. This can involve using active listening, acknowledging emotions, and offering alternative solutions.\u00a0In certain scenarios, verbal de-escalation may be more effective than physical force in preventing harm or danger. However, it\u2019s important to note that de-escalation techniques should only be used if it\u2019s safe to do so. If a situation becomes physically violent, you may need to employ more advanced self-defense techniques. Causing a Scene Quite the opposite of de-escalation, this strategy calls for you to be as loud and attention-grabbing as possible. Scream. Throw things. Spit. If running away isn\u2019t an option, you want to make sure that anyone in the vicinity is going to notice that something is happening. Most attackers want an easy target and will move on if you put up a fight. Physical Self-Defense Techniques You can learn and practice physical defense skills through various disciplines like martial arts, boxing, or self-defense classes. There are also a few skills you can learn on your own. Here are some key techniques to practice. Ideally, you\u2019re using force to give yourself enough time to run away or call for help. Physically overpowering your attacker isn\u2019t the best plan of action unless there\u2019s no other option. But if you\u2019re going to fight, be prepared to fight hard \u2014to injure or incapacitate. Traditional Hand-to-Hand Combat You can always try punching, kicking, scratching, biting, or gouging at your attacker. Sometimes, these aren\u2019t the most efficient or effective options, but anything that causes damage is fair game. Lower your center of gravity and keep your limbs close to your body when possible. As soon as you have ample opportunity to run, make a break for it. Palm Strike Use an open palm to strike the attacker\u2019s nose, throat, or eyes. Think of the movement as a thrust, rather than a chop. The heel of your palm is the strongest, meatiest part of your hand\u2014that\u2019s where you should exert force. Try to keep your thumb tucked in so you don\u2019t jam or break it. This can be an effective way to quickly disable an attacker, giving you time to escape. Alternatively, it gives you the opportunity to scratch the attacker\u2019s face or eyes. Groin Kick A kick or knee to the groin region is a \u201clow blow\u201d in sports, but it\u2019s fair game in genuine self-defense. Grabbing the attacker\u2019s shoulders may give you extra stability. If you opt for a kick, your goal is to make contact with your flexed ankle hooked around the attacker\u2019s crotch. The subsequent maximizes pain. As you might guess, a groin kick is most effective against male attackers. This technique is best for close-range attacks and can disable an attacker temporarily\u2014long enough for you to run away. Elbow Strike Similar to a palm strike, your goal is to use your elbow to hit your attacker\u2019s neck, jaw, or temple. Try to throw your weight into the blow. If the attacker is behind you, an elbow strike is still an effective choice. Simply raise your elbow and pivot sharply, making contact with the back of the elbow. Joint Locks Joint locks involve using joint manipulation or pressure points to control an attacker\u2019s movements and subdue them without causing serious injury. The basic idea is to push body parts past their normal range of movement such that you immobilize or hurt the other person. You\u2019ve probably seen joint locks in wrestling, judo, or other contact combat sports. Options include: Wristlocks\u2014Twisting or bending the wrist and often bending the same arm behind the person\u2019s body Armlocks\u2014A maneuver that hyperextends the elbow and/or shoulder Leglocks\u2014Any move directed at the ankle, knee, or hip joints Spinal locks\u2014Twisting the opponent\u2019s spine or neck Small joint manipulation\u2014Bending small body parts like fingers and toes to cause pain These are advanced techniques that are best learned in a structured, safe gym setting. By design, joint locks are designed to force the opponent into submission. When you\u2019re faced with an attacker who\u2019s larger than you are, a more capable fighter, or armed, joint locks are likely not your best choice. Non-Lethal Tools and Weapons If you want more \u201cfirepower\u201d than your own body can offer, but the idea of potentially causing death or grave bodily harm isn\u2019t something you\u2019re comfortable with, non-lethal self-defense products are a suitable alternative. You can find a variety of products at big-box stores, firearms stores, and online. Many of these devices are inexpensive. Common types of non-lethal self-defense products are: Pepper spray Pepper irritant projectile/gun Taser Stun gun Self-defense baton (Less lethal) bean-bag or rubber firearm ammunition Although these weapons won\u2019t cause death or permanent damage, you should still learn about them and train with them before carrying them with you or keeping them in your home. Knowing how to quickly, effectively, and safely deploy these products could mean the difference between escaping a threat or becoming a victim. And, in an emergency, nearly anything you\u2019re holding can be an impromptu weapon. Hitting an attacker with your palm is great, but whacking with an umbrella or metal water bottle is even better. Lethal Weapons Using deadly force isn\u2019t for everyone. Even if it\u2019s the correct course of action, taking someone else\u2019s life can create immense mental and emotional strife. That\u2019s not to mention the hassle of police and legal proceedings to make sure everything was above board. If you\u2019re committed to using a lethal weapon, consistent training and education are incredibly important to ensure you\u2019re able to protect yourself effectively\u2014and, more importantly, safely. Firearms and knives are the most common self-defense tools used for lethal force.\u00a0The specific type of firearm or knife you choose to carry or keep in your home depends on many factors. These include whether you want to conceal the weapon, your hand size and strength, your skill level, desired accuracy, weapon style, and so on. If you are unfamiliar with the safe, legal, and proper use of a firearm or knife for self-defense, it\u2019s vital to get the training and resources you need before making a purchase. These tools are highly effective when protecting against an attacker, but only when used by someone with the skills and knowledge to do so. Because this is such a delicate and specialized topic, with many state-level nuances, we\u2019ll leave the details to your local dealer. Creating a Home Defense Plan The easiest way to \u201cwin\u201d a fight is to prevent the fight in the first place. To that end, strong security is your best defense at home. Install a : Intruders are much less likely to attack a home with visible cameras. Deep Sentinel uses smart backed by AI threat detection and live guard intervention to protect you from trouble.

By practicing situational awareness, you can avoid threats altogether, or at least have a better chance of protecting yourself. This skill is particularly important if you often find yourself in high-risk environments such as public transportation, crowded events, or traveling alone. Running and Evasion Another alternative to physical confrontation is using strategies to escape or evade a potential threat. This can include running away, finding a hidden location like a safe room in your home, and calling for help. If you exercise regularly, work sprints, jumps, and climbing maneuvers into your fitness routine. De-escalation Verbal de-escalation is the use of communication techniques to defuse a potentially violent situation. This can involve using active listening, acknowledging emotions, and offering alternative solutions. In certain scenarios, verbal de-escalation may be more effective than physical force in preventing harm or danger. However, it\u2019s important to note that de-escalation techniques should only be used if it\u2019s safe to do so. If a situation becomes physically violent, you may need to employ more advanced self-defense techniques. Causing a Scene Quite the opposite of de-escalation, this strategy calls for you to be as loud and attention-grabbing as possible. Scream. Throw things. Spit. If running away isn\u2019t an option, you want to make sure that anyone in the vicinity is going to notice that something is happening. Most attackers want an easy target and will move on if you put up a fight. Physical Self-Defense Techniques You can learn and practice physical defense skills through various disciplines like martial arts, boxing, or self-defense classes. There are also a few skills you can learn on your own. Here are some key techniques to practice. Ideally, you\u2019re using force to give yourself enough time to run away or call for help. Physically overpowering your attacker isn\u2019t the best plan of action unless there\u2019s no other option. But if you\u2019re going to fight, be prepared to fight hard \u2014to injure or incapacitate. Traditional Hand-to-Hand Combat You can always try punching, kicking, scratching, biting, or gouging at your attacker. Sometimes, these aren\u2019t the most efficient or effective options, but anything that causes damage is fair game. Lower your center of gravity and keep your limbs close to your body when possible. As soon as you have ample opportunity to run, make a break for it. Palm Strike Use an open palm to strike the attacker\u2019s nose, throat, or eyes. Think of the movement as a thrust, rather than a chop. The heel of your palm is the strongest, meatiest part of your hand\u2014that\u2019s where you should exert force. Try to keep your thumb tucked in so you don\u2019t jam or break it. This can be an effective way to quickly disable an attacker, giving you time to escape. Alternatively, it gives you the opportunity to scratch the attacker\u2019s face or eyes. Groin Kick A kick or knee to the groin region is a \u201clow blow\u201d in sports, but it\u2019s fair game in genuine self-defense. Grabbing the attacker\u2019s shoulders may give you extra stability. If you opt for a kick, your goal is to make contact with your flexed ankle hooked around the attacker\u2019s crotch. The subsequent maximizes pain. As you might guess, a groin kick is most effective against male attackers. This technique is best for close-range attacks and can disable an attacker temporarily\u2014long enough for you to run away. Elbow Strike Similar to a palm strike, your goal is to use your elbow to hit your attacker\u2019s neck, jaw, or temple. Try to throw your weight into the blow. If the attacker is behind you, an elbow strike is still an effective choice. Simply raise your elbow and pivot sharply, making contact with the back of the elbow. Joint Locks Joint locks involve using joint manipulation or pressure points to control an attacker\u2019s movements and subdue them without causing serious injury. The basic idea is to push body parts past their normal range of movement such that you immobilize or hurt the other person. You\u2019ve probably seen joint locks in wrestling, judo, or other contact combat sports. Options include: Wristlocks\u2014Twisting or bending the wrist and often bending the same arm behind the person\u2019s body Armlocks\u2014A maneuver that hyperextends the elbow and/or shoulder Leglocks\u2014Any move directed at the ankle, knee, or hip joints Spinal locks\u2014Twisting the opponent\u2019s spine or neck Small joint manipulation\u2014Bending small body parts like fingers and toes to cause pain These are advanced techniques that are best learned in a structured, safe gym setting. By design, joint locks are designed to force the opponent into submission. When you\u2019re faced with an attacker who\u2019s larger than you are, a more capable fighter, or armed, joint locks are likely not your best choice. Non-Lethal Tools and Weapons If you want more \u201cfirepower\u201d than your own body can offer, but the idea of potentially causing death or grave bodily harm isn\u2019t something you\u2019re comfortable with, non-lethal self-defense products are a suitable alternative. You can find a variety of products at big-box stores, firearms stores, and online. Many of these devices are inexpensive. Common types of non-lethal self-defense products are: Pepper spray Pepper irritant projectile/gun Taser Stun gun Self-defense baton (Less lethal) bean-bag or rubber firearm ammunition Although these weapons won\u2019t cause death or permanent damage, you should still learn about them and train with them before carrying them with you or keeping them in your home. Knowing how to quickly, effectively, and safely deploy these products could mean the difference between escaping a threat or becoming a victim. And, in an emergency, nearly anything you\u2019re holding can be an impromptu weapon. Hitting an attacker with your palm is great, but whacking with an umbrella or metal water bottle is even better. Lethal Weapons Using deadly force isn\u2019t for everyone. Even if it\u2019s the correct course of action, taking someone else\u2019s life can create immense mental and emotional strife. That\u2019s not to mention the hassle of police and legal proceedings to make sure everything was above board. If you\u2019re committed to using a lethal weapon, consistent training and education are incredibly important to ensure you\u2019re able to protect yourself effectively\u2014and, more importantly, safely. Firearms and knives are the most common self-defense tools used for lethal force. The specific type of firearm or knife you choose to carry or keep in your home depends on many factors. These include whether you want to conceal the weapon, your hand size and strength, your skill level, desired accuracy, weapon style, and so on. If you are unfamiliar with the safe, legal, and proper use of a firearm or knife for self-defense, it\u2019s vital to get the training and resources you need before making a purchase. These tools are highly effective when protecting against an attacker, but only when used by someone with the skills and knowledge to do so. Because this is such a delicate and specialized topic, with many state-level nuances, we\u2019ll leave the details to your local dealer. Creating a Home Defense Plan The easiest way to \u201cwin\u201d a fight is to prevent the fight in the first place. To that end, strong security is your best defense at home. Install a : Intruders are much less likely to attack a home with visible cameras. Deep Sentinel uses smart backed by AI threat detection and live guard intervention to protect you from trouble.

Just because you might be able to handle doesn't necessarily mean you know how to protect yourself. But you absolutely should. We asked safety experts for some self-defense techniques and beginner-friendly moves that will give you the best chance of escape (and empower you for the times you feel unsafe but aren't in imminent danger). , fourth-degree black belt and creator of DFWM (Don't F*** With Me) Self Defense Training Jarrett Arthur, a self-defense expert in New York City and co-owner of Jarrett and Jennie Self-Defense How to Reduce Your Vulnerability to Attacks While it's easy to think about obvious situations where you might be attacked, there are those that aren't so obvious, namely when you're in your car. Women have a tendency to get into their car and sit while they check messages\u2014a habit that can actually spell trouble. \"If a predator is watching you, this is the perfect opportunity for that person to get in the passenger side, [threaten you], and tell you where to go,\" says fourth-degree black belt and trainer Teri Jory. That's why as soon as you get in the car, as a matter of habit, you should immediately lock the doors and leave. Also, if you're at a party, stick with friends, and if you've left a drink out of sight even for a few seconds, get a new one. \"Spiking a drink with a date rape drug can happen quickly,\" Jory says. When going on a date, tell family or friends where you're going, especially if this is a first date or blind date. If somebody pushes you to do something you don't want to do, know that you have a right to leave. And, of course, charge your cell phone and keep it and a charger on you at all times. Beginner-Friendly Self-Defense Moves Fortunately, you don't have to have a black belt in karate to learn how to defend yourself. Just practice these self-defense moves at home frequently so you'll feel confident using them if you're confronted. \"Not only does basic self-defense knowledge make you safer and increase your chance of surviving a violent assault, it also contributes to feelings of confidence and personal power,\" says self defense expert Jarrett Arthur. 01of 07 Situational Awareness When to use it: Self-defense actually starts before needing to react to the worst-case scenario\u2014with self-awareness and preventive strategies. The first step is paying attention to your surroundings using Situational Awareness skills, says Jory. How to do it: Being aware of your surroundings means only walking and parking in well-lit areas. Another example is keeping your keys (with a safety whistle, defense spray, or safety necklace, if you desire) easily accessible as you approach your car or front door. Trust your instincts, and if something doesn't feel right, create distance from the situation immediately. 02of 07 Make a Scene When to use it: The second part of preventive self-defense involves sounding the alarm by making a scene. If ever you're in a precarious situation, it's time to go into escape mode\u2014you want to do whatever is necessary to get away and survive. And remember: \"Know that you can escape even against somebody bigger or stronger than you,\" Jory says. The first thing you should do is try to scream and escape. How to do it: If somebody's in your face or you're in a situation where you're unsafe or uncomfortable, yell \"back off\" or simply scream. \"You're trying to get other people's attention and let the predator know you're not an easy target,\" Jory says. If someone gets their hands on you, then try some defensive moves that could open up the opportunity for an escape. 03of 07 Ready Stance Credit: Yeji Kim When to use it: Use this from a distance as a way of setting a strong body-language boundary (like if somebody's following you) or when you're engaged in sending physical strikes. You're more vulnerable on the ground versus standing. Although ending up on the ground during an assault is a real possibility, remaining on your feet should be a priority, says Arthur. How to do it: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands by your sides. Keeping your toes pointed forward, take a natural step forward with your non-dominant leg, so your feet are staggered. Bend both knees slightly, elevate the back heel, bring your hands up with your hands about 12 inches from your face and your palms facing forward, tuck your chin, and shrug your shoulders slightly. Distribute your body weight between both feet, placing it more in the balls versus heels. 04of 07 Palm-Heel Strike Credit: Yeji Kim When to use it: This is a last-resort move to create escape opportunities. \"It's best used when the face of the attacker isn't blocked or covered, and you can reach the face with your arms outstretched,\" Arthur says. How to do it: Start in Ready Stance and keep your hands up. Rotating your left hip and shoulder, explosively extend your left palm straight out, with your fingertips straight up and elbow down. Keep your right hand up to protect your face. Immediately recoil your left arm, returning your shoulder and hip to the square ready stance. With your feet in the same position, send a palm strike with your right hand (be sure to rotate your right hip), then try a left-right combination. If you are left-handed, practice a right-left combination. Your hand should stay open (i.e., don't make a fist), and the heel of your palm should make contact with the attacker's nose. Areas of an attacker's body that are most vulnerable include not only the eyes, nose, throat, and groin. \"Effective striking to these areas is most likely to slow, stun, or stop an attacker long enough to get away,\" says Arthur. 05of 07 Front Kick to Groin Credit: Yeji Kim When to use it: This is another last-resort move to create escape opportunities. It's particularly beneficial against somebody who's tall, Arthur says, especially if you can't reach their face for Palm-Heel Strikes. How to do it: Start in Ready Stance, keeping hands up. Bend your right leg and drive your right knee straight up. As soon as the right knee is above your waistline, extend your hips (almost bend backward to generate power in the left leg/your loading leg) and kick your right shin directly to the attacker's groin, making sure to keep your toes pointed downward and out of the way. Immediately release your right foot behind you and return to Ready Stance. 06of 07 Hammerfist Punch Credit: Yeji Kim When to use it: Rely on the Hammerfist Punch move in almost any situation where you find yourself in danger, Jory says. It's most effective, though, when used to hit the attacker directly in the face, particularly the nose, jaw, or temple. How to do it: Start in Ready Stance. Raise your dominant hand up, bending at the elbow (like you're preparing to throw a ball). Rotate your hips toward attacker and bring your dominant arm down, smacking the attacker in face (aim for the nose) with the meaty bottom part of fist. If you're practicing this move, recoil to Ready Stance and repeat. In a real-world scenario, strike the punch and run while the attacker is incapacitated. 07of 07 Elbow Strike When to use it: If an attacker grabs you from behind, your arm movement will be limited, which will make the other moves more difficult. The Elbow Strike is meant to create some distance between you and the attacker. The effectiveness of this move depends on force and the element of surprise, so plan your move accordingly with your dominant arm. How to do it: Stabilize your stance as much as possible, like you would in your Ready Stance. If positioning allows, lift your dominant elbow and deliver a firm, quick strike to the assailant's temple, jaw, or nose while turning your torso toward the attacker. Repeat. If your arms are pinned, tighten your arm muscles and form a fist. Drive your elbow back and down as you turn your torso toward the attacker. Aim for the stomach, ribs, or groin area. Drive the arm forward and repeat with alternating elbows until the grip on you has been loosened, then run to safety. Credit: Yeji Kim Explore more: Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

Self-defense is all about using your smarts, especially when you are a woman alone amongst the big-city bullies. In the chaos of the metropolitan madness, forget practising karate chops and opt for more practical measures to keep safe. Leave the pepper spray behind and use these five self-defense tips to handle eve-teasers. Keep alert It is imperative to always be aware of your surroundings when you are travelling alone, be it day or night. Staying plugged into iPods and Mp3 players or on hands-free devices can spell doom for girls in the city. Being oblivious to your surroundings can mean walking into danger without even being aware. If you\u2019re on the phone, always keep an eye out on the road for suspicious characters. Keep the police or close family and friends on speed dial to make it easier to call for help in such situations. Raise the alarm Most times ignoring ruffian men who whistle at you and pass comments may be the best course of action. But, if the harassment persists, you cannot be a sitting duck. Lash out at the harasser and create a scene; let passers-by come to your rescue. Threaten to call the cops and keep your calm till help arrives. It is important to get the support of someone who can take over and handle the situation calmly. Make sure you are not in a vulnerable spot where you become an easy target for assault. Body language If you are being leered at, never get agitated as it betrays your nervousness and fear. Confidence is the key to throwing potential eve-teasers off your track. Walk purposefully and never let your observation skills slip. You have to train your mind to be calm even if you know you have to put up a fight. Look the eve teaser in the eye; this should unsettle him. Use public transport Aside from avoiding poorly lit streets and isolated alleys, an easier way to stay safe from hooliganism is to use public transport. Shelter yourself in the throngs of people on trains and buses. With the share-a-cab option, you can not only save money, but keep safe travelling where women are in the majority. Create a carpool from home to work or college, if public transport is not your cup of tea. Do not take anything for granted when it comes to rickshawwallas and cab drivers. Make it a habit to take down the license number of the vehicle you are travelling in, in case you need to make a police complaint. Dress appropriately If you are going to spend the day in crowded areas, save the skimpy clothes. True, women in salwar kameezes get harassed as well, but there's no need to call attention to yourself. Carrying a shawl isn\u2019t really a solution; rather make sure you have a guy friend with you at all times and a phone handy to call for help. Eve teasing is one thing we will just not put up with. Is there something else that drives you mad, but you feel you can\u2019t do anything about? Well, it\u2019s time to make \u2018Nahi Chalega\u2019 your motto! As a modern woman of today, you need to adopt a stronger stance. Here\u2019s the perfect platform to voice your opinion on things you refuse to tolerate! Big or small, funny or serious, just get it off your chest.

Lash out at the harasser and create a scene; let passers-by come to your rescue. Threaten to call the cops and keep your calm till help arrives. It is important to get the support of someone who can take over and handle the situation calmly. Make sure you are not in a vulnerable spot where you become an easy target for assault. Body language If you are being leered at, never get agitated as it betrays your nervousness and fear. Confidence is the key to throwing potential eve-teasers off your track. Walk purposefully and never let your observation skills slip. You have to train your mind to be calm even if you know you have to put up a fight. Look the eve teaser in the eye; this should unsettle him. Use public transport Aside from avoiding poorly lit streets and isolated alleys, an easier way to stay safe from hooliganism is to use public transport. Shelter yourself in the throngs of people on trains and buses. With the share-a-cab option, you can not only save money, but keep safe travelling where women are in the majority. Create a carpool from home to work or college, if public transport is not your cup of tea. Do not take anything for granted when it comes to rickshawwallas and cab drivers. Make it a habit to take down the license number of the vehicle you are travelling in, in case you need to make a police complaint. Dress appropriately If you are going to spend the day in crowded areas, save the skimpy clothes. True, women in salwar kameezes get harassed as well, but there's no need to call attention to yourself. Carrying a shawl isn\u2019t really a solution; rather make sure you have a guy friend with you at all times and a phone handy to call for help. Eve teasing is one thing we will just not put up with. Is there something else that drives you mad, but you feel you can\u2019t do anything about? Well, it\u2019s time to make \u2018 Nahi Chalega \u2019 your motto! As a modern woman of today, you need to adopt a stronger stance. Here\u2019s the perfect platform to voice your opinion on things you refuse to tolerate! Big or small, funny or serious, just get it off your chest.

Getting a weird vibe from a stranger on the bus? Many of us have been there. In a of 1,000 women nationwide, 81 percent reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment, assault, or both in their lifetime. Verbal harassment was the most common form, but 51 percent of women said they were touched or groped in an unwelcome way, while 27 percent of women survived sexual assault. Even if you\u2019ve personally never felt yourself in a situation that made you feel physically unsafe, having reassurance about your next steps (and what you can do to help yourself should the unfortunate circumstance ever happen) can make all the difference. A from the University of Oregon found that women who participated in a self-defense class felt they: had better safety strategies in place were more equipped to deal with strangers, and people they know, in the context of potential assault or abuse had more positive feelings about their bodies had increased self-confidence Below are our top eight self-defense moves for women \u2014 complete with instructions \u2014 to help you feel empowered to defend yourself in any situation. Focus on the vulnerable areas Focus on your attacker\u2019s vulnerable places: eyes, nose, throat, and groin. Aim all of the moves below at one or several of these areas to have maximum impact. Avoid the chest and knees Don\u2019t aim for the chest, as that tends to be ineffective. Aiming for the knees requires a specific kick that can be too risky for the average person. Use all of your force and aggression during execution. Make it known that you\u2019re a powerful lady. Use your voice, too. Be loud to intimidate the attacker and create attention in case somebody is nearby. 1. Hammer strike Using your car keys is one of the easiest ways to defend yourself. Don\u2019t use your fingernails, because you\u2019re more at risk to injure your hands. Instead, if you feel unsafe while walking at night, have your keys stick out from one side of your fist for hammer strikes. Share on Pinterest Another way to use your keys is to click them onto a lanyard to swing at your attacker. Share on Pinterest To perform: Hold your key ring in a tight fist, like holding a hammer, with keys extending from the side of your hand. Thrust downward toward your target. 2. Groin kick If someone is coming at you from the front, a groin kick may deliver enough force to paralyze your attacker, making your escape possible. Share on Pinterest To perform: Stabilize yourself as best you can. Lift your dominant leg off the ground and begin to drive your knee upward. Extend your dominant leg, drive hips forward, slightly lean back, and kick forcefully, making contact between your lower shin or ball of your foot and the attacker\u2019s groin area. Alternative: If your attacker is too close, thrust your knee toward the groin. Make sure you\u2019re stabilized and not at risk of falling over. 3. Heel palm strike This move can cause damage to the nose or throat. To execute, get in front of your attacker as much as is possible. Share on Pinterest To perform: With your dominant hand, flex your wrist. Aim for either the attacker\u2019s nose, jabbing upward from the nostrils, or underneath the attacker\u2019s chin, jabbing upward at the throat. Make sure to recoil your strike. Pulling your arm back quickly will help thrust the attacker\u2019s head up and back. This will cause your attacker to stagger backward, allowing you to escape their grasp. Alternative: An open palm to the ears can be very disorienting. 4. Elbow strike If your attacker is in close range and you\u2019re unable to get enough momentum to throw a strong punch or kick, use your elbows. Share on Pinterest To perform: If you can, stabilize yourself with a strong core and legs to ensure a powerful blow. Bend your arm at the elbow, shift your weight forward, and strike your elbow into your attacker\u2019s neck, jawline, chin, or temple. These are all effective targets. This may cause your attacker to loosen their grip, allowing you to run. 5. Alternative elbow strikes Depending on how you\u2019re standing when you\u2019re initially attacked, you may be in a better position for variations on the elbow strike. Share on Pinterest To perform from the front: Lift your elbow to shoulder height. Pivot on same-side foot and allow your hips to rotate, creating more momentum into the front part of your elbow when you strike. To perform from the side and back: Make sure you see the target. Bring your elbow up and pivot your opposite foot, rotating your hips and turning into the target, making contact with the back part of your elbow. 6. Escape from a \u2018bear hug attack\u2019 For cases where the attacker is coming from behind, you\u2019ll want to use this move. Focus on getting low and creating space to free yourself. Share on Pinterest To perform: Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight forward, making it more difficult for your attacker to pick you up. It also gives you a better angle to throw elbows from side to side to the attacker\u2019s face. Turn into the attacker with one of your elbows and continue counterattacking. This should give you space to turn fully, using another move to injure the face or strike the groin. With the space these moves have created, you may be able to escape and run away. 7. Escape with hands trapped If your attacker comes from behind and traps your arms (this is similar to a bear hug, but you won\u2019t be able to move as freely), here\u2019s what to do: Share on Pinterest First reaction should be to stop your attacker\u2019s arms from going higher into a headlock. Shift your hips to one side. This gives an opening for strikes to the groin with open-handed slaps. Bring your hand back up to your arms and raise your opposite elbow to turn into the wrap. Keep your arms tight to your chest as you\u2019re turning in. Stay aggressive with your knees and other counterattacks until you can disengage. 8. Escape from side headlock When the attacker locks their arm around your head from the side, your first instinct should be to avoid getting choked. Share on Pinterest To perform: Turn into the attacker\u2019s side as much as possible to avoid being choked. With your hand that\u2019s furthest away, strike the groin with open-handed slaps until you have enough mobility to turn your head all the way out to disengage. How to stay safe if you aren\u2019t physically able to protect yourself However, if you don\u2019t feel confident you\u2019re able to physically handle an attacker, take these precautions: Safety tips Stay in a well-lit public area. Don\u2019t go home or turn away from crowds. Walk into a store or a coffee shop and ask for help. Call the police. Find a well-lit public area and dial 911 or your local emergency services if you feel you\u2019re in danger. Carry protection. Whether pepper spray, a personal safety alarm, or a lipstick taser, self-defense tools can help you feel more at ease. If you\u2019re carrying self-defense tools, make sure to get training on how to use them. You can also use more common objects as weapons, including a purse, briefcase, umbrella, phone, pencil, book, or rock. Anything blunt that can be used to hit, throw, stab, or swing can be very effective. Learn to develop boundaries, even with people you know The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network reports that of sexual violence cases aren\u2019t committed by random strangers in a dark alley, but by people we know: friends, family, partners, co-workers, etc. This can cause us to let our guard down. We might be too embarrassed, too shy, or too scared to hurt others\u2019 feelings that we don\u2019t always think about ourselves. Some essential principles of prevention also include: Awareness. Make sure you\u2019re aware of your environment as much as possible. Limit distractions when walking from place to place or other public settings. Don\u2019t constantly stare down at your phone. Make sure you can hear around you. Have keys ready. Walk with a purpose. Boundaries. Make it a point to ask yourself why somebody makes you uncomfortable. Be verbal with them. No matter how much you want a friendship or relationship to work, if they can\u2019t respect your boundaries, they\u2019re somebody you shouldn\u2019t have in your life. Where or how to get practice Whether someone is coming at you from the front, side, or back, basic self-defense knowledge can put you in a spot to properly defend yourself. If Krav Maga or muay thai classes are offered in your area, consider signing up. Muay thai is a combat sport in Thailand that uses stand-up striking techniques. Krav Maga is a modern self-defense system. If you want to build strength in a high-intensity situation and learn self-defense moves, check out your local kickboxing or any other martial arts courses, like karate. When equipped with some basic self-defense knowledge, women young or old, city dwellers or country residents, can have confidence in their personal safety and protection. No matter what type of combat or self-defense class you take, practicing can help you develop muscle memory. In a flight-or-flight situation, this muscle memory can be key to helping you escape from an attacker.

        "markdown": "\u00d7 \u00d7 3 Self-Defense Strategies Everyone Should Know While many self-defense classes largely focus on physical techniques, learning how to avoid or stop a potential altercation before it turns physical is just as crucial. Published: January 15, 2024Author: Bill Pinckney [display_slideshow_copyright_text] Photo: iQoncept - stock.adobe.com Note: The views expressed by guest bloggers and contributors are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, Campus Safety. Most personal safety (or in other words self-defense) courses or seminars dedicate a great deal, if not all their training time, to the physical techniques meant to deter an assailant. Preparing students with only physical techniques leaves out a large chunk of information that is crucial to avoiding or stopping a potential altercation BEFORE it turns physical. The reality is that most self-defense training can be setting up the student for failure, and in the worst-case scenario, catastrophic results. For any self-defense or personal safety program to be both effective and comprehensive, three sets of skills must be introduced and developed by the participants: Awareness skills Clear boundary-setting skills Physical defense as a last resort It does not matter what martial art you study or choose to study. What matters most is your mindset. The objective of this article is to provide individuals with a more secure mindset by empowering them with the ability to be better prepared to defend themselves \u2014 either through heightened situational awareness skills, more effective verbal/nonverbal communication skills (boundary setting), and as a last resort \u2013 physical self-defense. \u2014\u2014Article Continues Below\u2014\u2014 Get the latest industry news and research delivered directly to your inbox each week! Sign Up By clicking Sign Up above, you agree to the Emerald and . Let us explore these three critical components. 1. Awareness As a lifelong student of the martial arts and teaching on college campuses for over a decade \u2014 both in the classroom and in seminar settings \u2014 I\u2019ve found my biggest area of concern is a complete lack of situational awareness exhibited by most people. Individuals have their heads buried in their cell phones; texting, checking emails, listening to music through their earbuds, and carrying on conversations \u2014 all leaving them unaware and distracted from what is going on around them. Adopting a \u201cswitched-on\u201d mindset is crucial and should become part of your persona. You must be aware of what is always going on around you. Simply adopting this mindset can help you from all types of threats. The ability to process what is going on around you and spot a potential danger before it has a chance to materialize should be your priority. The sociopathic nature of violent criminals is to target a potential victim that they perceive to be an easy target. Not being aware of your surroundings will make you an easy target . Learn to trust your instincts about people and things that seem out of place. Get in the habit of scanning the environment that you are in and remove yourself from the situation if you feel something is out of place and may pose a threat. The only way to avoid being the victim of a crime of opportunity is to remove the opportunity! Understanding the Victim Selection Process Predators tend to adhere to a specific set of conditions when choosing a potential victim. Knowing how they think and what patterns they are looking for will go a long way in your objective of preserving your personal safety. Learn to think like a predator by trying to see things from their perspective. Ask yourself: are you a hard target or a soft target? People are hard targets when they appear to be aware of their surroundings, carry themselves with confidence, and look like they can handle themselves in an altercation. People are soft targets when they display none of the outward signs of awareness or any type of preparation. A soft target looks distracted, unaware, easy to approach, and, unlike a hard target, not prepared to defend themselves in a physical confrontation. A predator will always pick the low-hanging fruit by measuring risk versus reward and always choosing the easiest path. The process of a predator determining a potential victim as a hard target or a soft target takes place in a matter of seconds. They analyze their initial perception of who you are, the amount of risk that you pose, if you are of any value, and if you have any visible or perceived defenses. You must make yourself the most unappealing target you can be. If you increase the risk you pose, the vast number of predators will go out of their way to avoid you, moving along to the next potential victim. The thing predators value most is their own personal safety. Therefore, situational awareness is the number one deterrent to street crimes. If you even remotely look like you would be a problem for them, they will look to the next potential target. The bottom line is it\u2019s important to be acutely aware of how you appear to others. Think like a predator. Remember, you cannot defend yourself against something you don\u2019t know is there. It is your responsibility to ingrain the habits of awareness and alertness to be in tune with your environment. Observational skills are critical. If you know who is around you and what they are doing, you are more in control. A criminal will reveal themselves through their actions. These actions can only be observed and interpreted by those who are paying attention to what is happening around them. Everyone is worth a second look . Situational awareness is primarily a mental exercise. When in public, always perform an initial scan, looking for anything that does not belong and anything outside of the standard behaviors of the environment you are in. Noticing anything outside of an established baseline relating to where you are starts with the initial scan. If you notice anything is out of place during your initial scan, you have two options: Leave the area immediately Take a closer look at your surroundings to collect more detailed observations Additional pre-incident indicators may include: An individual approaching you with hidden hands Target glancing \u2014 a term used to describe a subject\u2019s preoccupation with a potential target through repeated glancing Sudden change of movement Inappropriate clothing Seeking a position of advantage and/or impeding your movement Once someone rises above the established baseline and has exhibited at least three abnormal behaviors, it\u2019s safe to assume action is warranted. Aside from the additional pre-incident indicators we just covered, there are also specific physiological reactions to stress that act as precursors to violent actions. These are important to be aware of because they hold true across all cultures and age groups: Excessive sweating Heavier than usual breathing Appearing nervous or tense Pupil dilation Physical posturing Clenching fists Use what you know about your surroundings to identify potential problems and plan appropriate responses should one of these problems materialize. Be cognizant that the attacker always has the advantage. They pick the time, place, and method of the attack. They have the element of surprise on their side. A crime will occur when three conditions are met: 1) The presence of a potential and motivated offender; 2) The presence of a vulnerable target; and 3) The absence of effective defenses capable of stopping an attack. It\u2019s up to you to ensure that these three factors are not met. The way to counter this is through early detection and avoidance. Without proper situational awareness, a person is forced to be reactive. Through training and by exposing yourself to small levels of stress while training, \u2014 and increasing those levels \u2014 you can effectively prepare yourself to respond more effectively and to think more clearly under extreme pressure. Be proactive instead of reactive. Seek out competent professional self-defense training. 31 Key Tips for Awareness Here is an overall summary of using awareness as self-defense in everyday settings, like grocery stores or restaurants: Avoidance IS self-defense. When you walk into a room, make it a habit to identify all of the exits. Look at people\u2019s hands. Whether armed or unarmed, the hands are what can hurt you. Be aware of people who appear to be paying attention to what you are doing. Predators choose their victims based on their level of awareness and body language. When in a parking lot \u2013 are there cars parked with people sitting in them? Are those cars running? Be a hard target. Walk with your head up with purpose and confidence. KNOW your surroundings. Continually visualize \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. Always have an escape plan. Try to evaluate yourself from a predator\u2019s perspective. Distractions are the number one enemy of situational awareness. Through observation, spot anomalies within the established baseline. Pay attention to intuition. If a situation feels wrong, get out. Always keep your head up and scan your environment. Don\u2019t approach corners too closely; give yourself space to increase reaction time. Ask yourself \u2014 does this person have the means, intent, and opportunity to hurt me? Do not allow verbal conflicts to escalate. Stay away from places you know to be high-crime areas. When it comes to escape, space is your best friend. Distance removes an attacker\u2019s opportunity. You can\u2019t fight (or react) to something you don\u2019t see. It\u2019s better to prepare for violence and never face it than to be faced with violence and not be prepared for it. Never leave a drink unattended when at a restaurant or bar. Never sit with your back towards the entrance while in a restaurant. Be vigilant when buckling a child into a car seat or placing groceries in a car. Avoid being alone or traveling isolated routes while walking to and from school, work, or shopping. Use a \u201cbuddy system.\u201d Position yourself with your back to the wall with visibility of entrance points and close to alternate exits. If no plan is thought out, you are likely to hesitate in your reaction and a catastrophic result may be the consequence. Your mantra should be to identify the threat, avoid the threat, and escape the threat. Your mind is your best protection to avoid a conflict. No stranger gets in your house\u2026 EVER. Never go to Crime Scene #2. If all they want is money, give it to them, but if they want to take you to a secondary location, make your stand right there. You have a better chance of surviving. Statistics show you will not escape or be rescued if you allow yourself to go to a secondary location. 2. Boundary Setting Most conflicts can be avoided if you establish clear boundaries. This skill is the most useful and often the most difficult to develop for the simple reason that we were all brought up by our parents to be polite, helpful, and respectful. Some people are uncomfortable being overtly direct. Through verbal/non-verbal communication, one needs to establish clear boundaries. There is an importance of speaking firmly and clearly and meaning what you say. Predators have the uncanny ability to detect a lack of belief in oneself. Express those boundaries in a non-confrontational yet effective way. You don\u2019t want to come across as aggressive nor do you want to come across as passive as many times this elicits the same response. You need to be ASSERTIVE and develop skills. Standing straight, making eye contact, feet staggered and shoulder-width apart, hands open and palms facing forward (this is also a universal sign of neutrality and an excellent defensive position) is called your \u201cready stance.\u201d When you feel your personal space has been breached, verbally command the person to: \u201cBACK OFF\u201d \u201cSTOP\u201d \u201cGET AWAY\u201d \u201cWHAT DO YOU WANT?\u201d \u201cBACK OFF, YOU ARE TOO CLOSE\u201d And turn up the volume every time you repeat yourself until you are yelling. You cannot be uncomfortable to tell someone to get out of your personal space. It is your responsibility to communicate when your personal space has been breached. More times than not, an assertive response by you will de-escalate and end a possible conflict because, once again, predators are looking for easy prey and don\u2019t expect you to be prepared and engaged. At this point, you do not seem to be as much of an easy target as you appeared to be for you to have been targeted to begin with. This applies to children as well as adults. A predator will likely move along and try to find another potential victim. BE ASSERTIVE TO AVOID BEING A TARGET. Aside from a random act of violence, I want to make you aware of the possibility of being attacked in seemingly normal interactions. What you think is a normal interaction may not be what it seems. A common technique predators use is to put their potential victim through an \u201cinterview\u201d process or sizing up a potential victim, such as asking for the time or requesting spare change while edging closer to see if your personal space can be breached. In an instant, an attack could occur. Another example would be asking for help due to some type of emergency. The element of someone needing our assistance may make it difficult for us to say no. The bottom line is that they are looking for what they think is easy prey. Consider that anyone could have malicious intentions and never allow convenience to outweigh security. Your ability to recognize an assailant\u2019s \u201cprobing\u201d process will determine your ability to prevail. The probing phase is a major characteristic of a predator. Recognize that an attack begins long before the actual assault. If you fail to recognize the development of the attack, your ability to mount a successful and effective response may not be possible. Self-protection is not about fighting. It\u2019s about awareness and commitment. If you develop strong awareness skills along with equally strong boundary setting skills, you will less likely be targeted because you are not an easy target! The mental aspect of self-defense is as important, maybe as useful, and more permanent than any form of physical training and should be prioritized. Mental training is the key to unlocking the maximum potential of physical training. Increase Distance or Introduce a Barricade When confronted with a real or perceived threat to your safety, immediately take action. Increase the distance between you and your threat, introduce a barricade, look for escape or help, or, lastly, defend yourself. Increasing distance is the best first action you can take when confronted with a perceived or real threat to your safety. By increasing the distance between you and a potential assailant, you create more options and time to react. If you see a threat across the street, for example, and you double the distance between you and your threat, you will be in a better position to make decisions and take action such as changing directions, running/walking away, or calling the police. Increased distance equals more time. If for some reason you cannot increase the distance between you and a potential threat, the next best option is to introduce or create a barricade. Anything can serve as a barricade \u2014 a chair, parked car, table, fence, building, etc. This in itself will increase the time needed to reach you. Always look for methods of escape or help. If all else fails, and you have no other option, physically defend yourself with full commitment until the threat is no longer a threat. Boundary Setting: Key Points Here\u2019s a summary of the boundary-setting principle for physical safety: Set strong verbal/non-verbal boundaries Assertive stance \u2013 feet staggered, shoulder-width apart, palms facing forward Look them in the eye \u2013 strong eye contact Establish a strong boundary using distance or objects Make clear statements: \u201cWHAT DO YOU WANT\u201d \u201cGO AWAY\u201d \u201cBACK OFF\u201d \u201cLEAVE ME ALONE\u201d \u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW THIS PERSON\u201d \u201cNO\u201d \u201cSTOP\u201d \u201cPLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE\u201d Be a broken record and get louder until it is effective. 3. Physical Self Defense When the reality of a potential conflict eclipses all reasoning, or in the event of a random act of violence, and you CANNOT avoid a conflict, you must rely on physical self-defense. You need to develop a combative mentality with no hesitation. Your mantra must be surprise, speed, and violence of action. The objective is to reverse the confrontational dynamic and make the predator the prey. Without exploring any physical techniques, it is important to understand how we all physiologically react under this type of stress. The Adrenal Stress Response A physical altercation is not unlike almost having a car accident. When we are under extreme duress, we become and go through several physiological responses such as: Auditory exclusion : Voices and sounds are muffled affecting our ability to hear Tunnel vision : We lose or have limited peripheral vision Visual slowdown : Things appear to be moving in slow motion Tremors and palpitations : This can create rapid or shortness of breath, shakiness, and sweating With this being said, when we are adrenalized, our fine motor skills are greatly diminished. Therefore, we must rely upon gross motor movements to compensate for the loss of fine motor skills. No matter the martial art you decide to study, the techniques that are taught have to be easy to learn, retainable, and most importantly, effective. Your objective in a street altercation (when you cannot avoid it) is to \u201cstun and run.\u201d If you can\u2019t run, continue your counterattack until your assailant is unable or unwilling to continue their attack. Real violence unfolds rapidly and may offer no preparation time. Physical action on your part has to be completely one-sided. You must be single-minded in your attempt to defeat the assailant. This mindset is miles apart from the sporting arena. There are no weight classes, rules, referees, or time limits. This is not a reciprocal event whereby the participants are trying to score points on each other. The person defending themself must immediately, brutally, and effectively reverse the confrontational dynamic and attack the attacker. Training should not focus on any type of sparring as this does not truly replicate how real-world violence occurs. You are in an environment with NO rules. Make the attacker react to you, rather than you react to him. Always keep constant forward pressure on the threat until there is no longer a threat. Take their space explosively and violently! The moral concern that many people struggle with is that we were brought up and taught that fighting is bad and we should treat people nicely. The reality is that you are up against someone who does not share the same values. Never be in the mindset that it can never happen to you. This will put you in a vulnerable state of mind. The best method of obtaining a comprehensive self-defense skill set is to train with a competent martial artist who understands that a large percentage of the population does not have the time nor the desire to devote to studying in a traditional martial arts setting. There is an interest in a subset of martial arts gaining traction termed \u201cCombatives.\u201d The reason Combatives is becoming popular is because it appeals to a wide audience as their curriculum has been developed for one purpose: succinct effective self-defense utilizing an intentional limited number of techniques that are applicable in multiple situations. This will provide the participants the ability to do the repetitions required to \u201cburn in\u201d and develop the motor memory needed to effectively execute the techniques. To quote military martial arts expert , \u201cWhat you learn in the afternoon must work for you that evening in the parking lot.\u201d Whatever approach you choose to train, take it wholeheartedly. Survival is not about style; it is about reality. You must be prepared both physically and psychologically. Your performance will be in parity with your preparation. You will not rise to the level of your expectations; you will fall to your level of training. Final Words In closing, I hope the most prominent message that you received here is that when confronted with someone who can do you harm, being nice doesn\u2019t work. Specifically, women who fight back are more likely to stop a sexual assault. In my opinion, first-year university students must participate in such a program. They are, for the first time in their lives, in a new environment away from their families and support structure that they have known their entire lives. Teaching women tools to protect themselves is a highly effective approach. Every time you train, train with the motivation and purpose that you will be the hardest person someone tries to assault. You won\u2019t get to pick who tries to hurt you. You won\u2019t get to pick when someone tries to hurt you. You won\u2019t get to pick why someone tries to hurt you. You won\u2019t get to pick what they will hurt you with. You will either be prepared or you won\u2019t. Hope is not a strategy. I don\u2019t teach people or introduce these principles to instill fear or stoke paranoia. I do it because I want to help as many people as possible to become more situationally aware and in turn, safer in the environment in which they live and interact in. I leave you with a quote by : \u201cSelf-defense is not just a set of techniques \u2014 it\u2019s a state of mind.\u201d Bill Pinckney is an adjunct professor in New Jersey State University\u2019s kinesiology department.

Published: January 15, 2024 Author: Bill Pinckney [display_slideshow_copyright_text] Photo: iQoncept - stock.adobe.com Note: The views expressed by guest bloggers and contributors are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, Campus Safety. Most personal safety (or in other words self-defense) courses or seminars dedicate a great deal, if not all their training time, to the physical techniques meant to deter an assailant. Preparing students with only physical techniques leaves out a large chunk of information that is crucial to avoiding or stopping a potential altercation BEFORE it turns physical. The reality is that most self-defense training can be setting up the student for failure, and in the worst-case scenario, catastrophic results. For any self-defense or personal safety program to be both effective and comprehensive, three sets of skills must be introduced and developed by the participants: Awareness skills Clear boundary-setting skills Physical defense as a last resort It does not matter what martial art you study or choose to study. What matters most is your mindset. The objective of this article is to provide individuals with a more secure mindset by empowering them with the ability to be better prepared to defend themselves \u2014 either through heightened situational awareness skills, more effective verbal/nonverbal communication skills (boundary setting), and as a last resort \u2013 physical self-defense. \u2014\u2014Article Continues Below\u2014\u2014 Get the latest industry news and research delivered directly to your inbox each week! Sign Up By clicking Sign Up above, you agree to the Emerald and . Let us explore these three critical components. 1. Awareness As a lifelong student of the martial arts and teaching on college campuses for over a decade \u2014 both in the classroom and in seminar settings \u2014 I\u2019ve found my biggest area of concern is a complete lack of situational awareness exhibited by most people. Individuals have their heads buried in their cell phones; texting, checking emails, listening to music through their earbuds, and carrying on conversations \u2014 all leaving them unaware and distracted from what is going on around them. Adopting a \u201cswitched-on\u201d mindset is crucial and should become part of your persona. You must be aware of what is always going on around you. Simply adopting this mindset can help you from all types of threats. The ability to process what is going on around you and spot a potential danger before it has a chance to materialize should be your priority. The sociopathic nature of violent criminals is to target a potential victim that they perceive to be an easy target. Not being aware of your surroundings will make you an easy target . Learn to trust your instincts about people and things that seem out of place. Get in the habit of scanning the environment that you are in and remove yourself from the situation if you feel something is out of place and may pose a threat. The only way to avoid being the victim of a crime of opportunity is to remove the opportunity! Understanding the Victim Selection Process Predators tend to adhere to a specific set of conditions when choosing a potential victim. Knowing how they think and what patterns they are looking for will go a long way in your objective of preserving your personal safety. Learn to think like a predator by trying to see things from their perspective. Ask yourself: are you a hard target or a soft target? People are hard targets when they appear to be aware of their surroundings, carry themselves with confidence, and look like they can handle themselves in an altercation. People are soft targets when they display none of the outward signs of awareness or any type of preparation. A soft target looks distracted, unaware, easy to approach, and, unlike a hard target, not prepared to defend themselves in a physical confrontation. A predator will always pick the low-hanging fruit by measuring risk versus reward and always choosing the easiest path. The process of a predator determining a potential victim as a hard target or a soft target takes place in a matter of seconds. They analyze their initial perception of who you are, the amount of risk that you pose, if you are of any value, and if you have any visible or perceived defenses. You must make yourself the most unappealing target you can be. If you increase the risk you pose, the vast number of predators will go out of their way to avoid you, moving along to the next potential victim. The thing predators value most is their own personal safety. Therefore, situational awareness is the number one deterrent to street crimes. If you even remotely look like you would be a problem for them, they will look to the next potential target. The bottom line is it\u2019s important to be acutely aware of how you appear to others. Think like a predator. Remember, you cannot defend yourself against something you don\u2019t know is there. It is your responsibility to ingrain the habits of awareness and alertness to be in tune with your environment. Observational skills are critical. If you know who is around you and what they are doing, you are more in control. A criminal will reveal themselves through their actions. These actions can only be observed and interpreted by those who are paying attention to what is happening around them. Everyone is worth a second look . Situational awareness is primarily a mental exercise. When in public, always perform an initial scan, looking for anything that does not belong and anything outside of the standard behaviors of the environment you are in. Noticing anything outside of an established baseline relating to where you are starts with the initial scan. If you notice anything is out of place during your initial scan, you have two options: Leave the area immediately Take a closer look at your surroundings to collect more detailed observations Additional pre-incident indicators may include: An individual approaching you with hidden hands Target glancing \u2014 a term used to describe a subject\u2019s preoccupation with a potential target through repeated glancing Sudden change of movement Inappropriate clothing Seeking a position of advantage and/or impeding your movement Once someone rises above the established baseline and has exhibited at least three abnormal behaviors, it\u2019s safe to assume action is warranted. Aside from the additional pre-incident indicators we just covered, there are also specific physiological reactions to stress that act as precursors to violent actions. These are important to be aware of because they hold true across all cultures and age groups: Excessive sweating Heavier than usual breathing Appearing nervous or tense Pupil dilation Physical posturing Clenching fists Use what you know about your surroundings to identify potential problems and plan appropriate responses should one of these problems materialize. Be cognizant that the attacker always has the advantage. They pick the time, place, and method of the attack. They have the element of surprise on their side. A crime will occur when three conditions are met: 1) The presence of a potential and motivated offender; 2) The presence of a vulnerable target; and 3) The absence of effective defenses capable of stopping an attack. It\u2019s up to you to ensure that these three factors are not met. The way to counter this is through early detection and avoidance. Without proper situational awareness, a person is forced to be reactive. Through training and by exposing yourself to small levels of stress while training, \u2014 and increasing those levels \u2014 you can effectively prepare yourself to respond more effectively and to think more clearly under extreme pressure. Be proactive instead of reactive. Seek out competent professional self-defense training. 31 Key Tips for Awareness Here is an overall summary of using awareness as self-defense in everyday settings, like grocery stores or restaurants: Avoidance IS self-defense. When you walk into a room, make it a habit to identify all of the exits. Look at people\u2019s hands. Whether armed or unarmed, the hands are what can hurt you. Be aware of people who appear to be paying attention to what you are doing. Predators choose their victims based on their level of awareness and body language. When in a parking lot \u2013 are there cars parked with people sitting in them? Are those cars running? Be a hard target. Walk with your head up with purpose and confidence. KNOW your surroundings. Continually visualize \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. Always have an escape plan. Try to evaluate yourself from a predator\u2019s perspective. Distractions are the number one enemy of situational awareness. Through observation, spot anomalies within the established baseline. Pay attention to intuition. If a situation feels wrong, get out. Always keep your head up and scan your environment. Don\u2019t approach corners too closely; give yourself space to increase reaction time. Ask yourself \u2014 does this person have the means, intent, and opportunity to hurt me? Do not allow verbal conflicts to escalate. Stay away from places you know to be high-crime areas. When it comes to escape, space is your best friend. Distance removes an attacker\u2019s opportunity. You can\u2019t fight (or react) to something you don\u2019t see. It\u2019s better to prepare for violence and never face it than to be faced with violence and not be prepared for it. Never leave a drink unattended when at a restaurant or bar. Never sit with your back towards the entrance while in a restaurant. Be vigilant when buckling a child into a car seat or placing groceries in a car. Avoid being alone or traveling isolated routes while walking to and from school, work, or shopping. Use a \u201cbuddy system.\u201d Position yourself with your back to the wall with visibility of entrance points and close to alternate exits.

You don\u2019t want to come across as aggressive nor do you want to come across as passive as many times this elicits the same response. You need to be ASSERTIVE and develop skills. Standing straight, making eye contact, feet staggered and shoulder-width apart, hands open and palms facing forward (this is also a universal sign of neutrality and an excellent defensive position) is called your \u201cready stance.\u201d When you feel your personal space has been breached, verbally command the person to: \u201cBACK OFF\u201d \u201cSTOP\u201d \u201cGET AWAY\u201d \u201cWHAT DO YOU WANT?\u201d \u201cBACK OFF, YOU ARE TOO CLOSE\u201d And turn up the volume every time you repeat yourself until you are yelling. You cannot be uncomfortable to tell someone to get out of your personal space. It is your responsibility to communicate when your personal space has been breached.

Real violence unfolds rapidly and may offer no preparation time. Physical action on your part has to be completely one-sided. You must be single-minded in your attempt to defeat the assailant. This mindset is miles apart from the sporting arena. There are no weight classes, rules, referees, or time limits. This is not a reciprocal event whereby the participants are trying to score points on each other. The person defending themself must immediately, brutally, and effectively reverse the confrontational dynamic and attack the attacker. Training should not focus on any type of sparring as this does not truly replicate how real-world violence occurs. You are in an environment with NO rules. Make the attacker react to you, rather than you react to him. Always keep constant forward pressure on the threat until there is no longer a threat. Take their space explosively and violently! The moral concern that many people struggle with is that we were brought up and taught that fighting is bad and we should treat people nicely. The reality is that you are up against someone who does not share the same values. Never be in the mindset that it can never happen to you. This will put you in a vulnerable state of mind. The best method of obtaining a comprehensive self-defense skill set is to train with a competent martial artist who understands that a large percentage of the population does not have the time nor the desire to devote to studying in a traditional martial arts setting. There is an interest in a subset of martial arts gaining traction termed \u201cCombatives.\u201d The reason Combatives is becoming popular is because it appeals to a wide audience as their curriculum has been developed for one purpose: succinct effective self-defense utilizing an intentional limited number of techniques that are applicable in multiple situations. This will provide the participants the ability to do the repetitions required to \u201cburn in\u201d and develop the motor memory needed to effectively execute the techniques. To quote military martial arts expert , \u201cWhat you learn in the afternoon must work for you that evening in the parking lot.\u201d Whatever approach you choose to train, take it wholeheartedly. Survival is not about style; it is about reality. You must be prepared both physically and psychologically. Your performance will be in parity with your preparation. You will not rise to the level of your expectations; you will fall to your level of training. Final Words In closing, I hope the most prominent message that you received here is that when confronted with someone who can do you harm, being nice doesn\u2019t work. Specifically, women who fight back are more likely to stop a sexual assault. In my opinion, first-year university students must participate in such a program. They are, for the first time in their lives, in a new environment away from their families and support structure that they have known their entire lives. Teaching women tools to protect themselves is a highly effective approach. Every time you train, train with the motivation and purpose that you will be the hardest person someone tries to assault. You won\u2019t get to pick who tries to hurt you. You won\u2019t get to pick when someone tries to hurt you. You won\u2019t get to pick why someone tries to hurt you. You won\u2019t get to pick what they will hurt you with. You will either be prepared or you won\u2019t. Hope is not a strategy. I don\u2019t teach people or introduce these principles to instill fear or stoke paranoia. I do it because I want to help as many people as possible to become more situationally aware and in turn, safer in the environment in which they live and interact in. I leave you with a quote by : \u201cSelf-defense is not just a set of techniques \u2014 it\u2019s a state of mind.\u201d Bill Pinckney is an adjunct professor in New Jersey State University\u2019s kinesiology department. He primarily teaches Karate and personal safety classes.

Introduction Self defense is the right to prevent suffering force or violence through the use of a sufficient level of counteracting force or violence. It is defined as the act of defending one\u2019s person when physically attacked, but also of defending oneself from any action that can cause harm to a person. This includes all acts of violence, ranging from nonaggressive to aggressive behavior. Self defense is protecting ourselves from people who have intentions of harming us. The interesting thing about self defense is that many of us have never had formal training on how to protect ourselves. Formal training is defined as taking courses in self defense or martial arts. This type of training allows one to learn the skills needed to defend him or herself. Many people believe that they can defend themselves simply by \"fighting dirty\". This is conclusion such as \"I would kick him in the balls and run\". While this is an effective way of protecting you, there are legal implications to every action taken. Taking formal training allows one to understand different laws in defense and the correct way of defending yourself without causing harm to others. Self defense can come in a variety of ways. This can range from physical, mental, or spiritual needs to defend oneself. An example of spiritual self defense would be refraining from an argument when you know it's not worth your time or energy. Mental self defense is using your mind to find ways to avoid certain situations or conflicts that can lead to harm. An example of mental defense is analyzing whether or not a situation is safe and choosing the best way to remove yourself from that situation. Physical self defense is the most common and most important way to defend oneself. This is the use of physical force to counter an immediate threat of violence. This can range from something as simple as using your hands to move an aggressor away from you or to striking someone with the intention of injury or de-escalating a threat. This is where training in martial arts can play an important role in self defense. Using physical self defense, a person under the threat of injury needs only to demonstrate intent to cause the aggressor to fear harmful force, and if the circumstances are sufficient, it will count as self defense if he uses force to disarm the aggressor. Self defense encompasses a wide range of things, it is not devolved or set around physical combat alone. 1.1. Definition of self-defense Self-defense is a countermeasure that involves defending the health and well-being of oneself from harm. The use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times of danger is available in many jurisdictions, but the interpretation varies widely. Physical self-defense is the use of physical force to counter an immediate threat of violence. Such force can be either armed or unarmed. In either case, the chances of success are seriously compromised if the person does not understand the physical force that is being used against him or her. It is often best to attempt to neutralize the attack with a use of force that is equal or lesser in strength. Attempts to neutralize the attack which involve a greater strength can cause more damage than good. It is also important to consider the relative strength of the assailant, because if the assailant is a professional boxer and you have experience in wrestling, striking the assailant might not be the best choice. Simulation of the techniques used in real self-defense involve training in combatives, practicing sparring skills, and the development of situational awareness.

Importance of self-defense in martial arts Self-defense techniques, specifically in martial arts, are very significant because the skills are based on protecting the person and other individuals on their own from physical harm. Self-defense training focuses on making the safest outcome when put in a situation where one is forced to protect themselves by using techniques effectively. Impact training often has a mental and physical state for the person practicing the art. There are many reasons why learning self-defense techniques is important for the mental and physical well-being of an individual. Self-defense techniques can enhance one's mental and physical health. Practicing martial arts is one of the best ways to learn and improve self-defense techniques. Self-defense techniques in martial arts will be the most effective way to learn the proper skills in protection and survival. Learning to effectively block, evade, and intercept an attack are the key concepts to a successful defense. Mastering these skills can be very difficult and takes a lot of training and patience. Learning and utilizing self-defense techniques can also give a person confidence and peace of mind. This is because they will feel secure in their ability to protect themselves and loved ones when put into a dangerous situation. Feeling safe and secure will lead to a clear and stress-free mind, which is very healthy for an individual. Having confidence itself can sometimes deter an attacker or prevent a situation from becoming hostile. Since the martial artist has confidence in his ability to defend himself, he will not feel the need to escalate a situation to violence. This can result in fewer physical confrontations with others. An important idea to understand is that a person can never predict when something dangerous may happen to them. Usually, people do not want to think about hazardous situations, but it is wise to be prepared and have a plan of action. This is where self-defense training comes into play. The skills learned are a preventative measure to stop a bad situation from getting worse. This can range from anything such as being aware of your surroundings in a potentially hostile environment, to completely avoiding dangerous situations. In some cases, the best self-defense is to run away and remove oneself from a dangerous situation. 2. Basic Self-Defense Techniques Punching is about getting your arm to extend rapidly and efficiently. With body motion, weight shifting, and extending the arm, you are able to increase the power of the punch, offering an effective and forceful blow. There are many different types of punches, each having a specific purpose. The jab punch is used to control or dominate the opponent. It is fast, and the lead hand does the majority of the work. The cross punch is used for more power and damage. The rear hand (stronger hand, if you are right-handed this would be your right hand, and if you are left-handed it is your left hand) gives a right straight punch, extending the body and making sure that the entire weight at the time is shifted to the back foot to give the power for the punch. The hook punch is used to slice to the opponent's head from a side angle. It is a hard punch used to cause a knockout. The hook punch is similar to the uppercut punch, which is used to strike upwards and to the head, which can also cause a knockout. An elbow strike is a close strike from the opponent with a bent arm. The elbow can be used for the majority of the strikes with the intention of causing heavy damage and pain. Elbows are used for striking from grapple/clinch situations and are also used as counter strikes. Elbows are great for self-defense because they are strong and simple to execute. Mitigating the damage from an opponent's strike, it is important to be able to block the strike. This can be executed using the hands/forearms to cover the head, or you could perform a defensive body movement to avoid the strike. In cases where there is no escape, it is effective to use a block with a counter strike with the intention of nullifying the opponent's attack. A counter strike is a strike executed while the opponent is preparing or executing an attack. This will, in effect, disrupt the opponent's rhythm and tempo as well as causing damage. This can be achieved using many different strikes and is a highly effective self-defense technique. 2.1. Punches and strikes Fist fights are common aspects of self-defense encounters. Here are some strikes that will increase your effectiveness in a fight. When punching, try to focus on the large part of the body such as the chest area and stomach. This is because the more distance between your fist and the opponent's head, the more time the opponent has to react and counter your strike. By focusing on the large part of the body, if your punch is effectively landed, it can cause internal damage to the opponent and will likely immobilize them, giving you time to create distance and escape. Normally, the most common punch is the jab. The jab is quick and is a good way to measure the distance between you and your opponent. This is an important aspect of combat. For instance, if your opponent has a longer reach than you and stays at a distance, without being able to measure the distance, it will be hard to close the gap and get into a position where it is possible for you to hit your opponent but your opponent cannot hit you. The best way to measure your distance is to let the opponent initiate an attack and when they are in range of hitting you, back out so the attack falls short of you. If you stay in this range and practice parrying a few times, you will learn that it is enough room to still be able to counterattack. 2.2. Kicks and knee strikes A kick is one of the most powerful strikes that can be delivered. Kicks can drive through a target, or break it, depending on the intention of the user. It is effectively used as a counter to other strikes, a vital part of ground fighting and most of all the foundation of all aerial techniques. Unfortunately, in a real self-defense situation, the user is often wearing heavy footwear and the target area may be small. This means that a mistimed or inaccurate kick may result in the user injuring themselves or missing the target completely. Therefore, it is essential for the user to learn the basic kicks and knee strikes and train in lighter footwear to ensure that the strikes can be executed rapidly and accurately. One of the most useful kicks in a self-defense situation is the front kick. It is a linear kick with the knee and foot aligned to the target. The sole of the foot is the part of the foot intended to strike the target but in the case of the legs giving way, the ball of the foot can be used. The rear leg is often the best to use because it can be pre-loaded and explode into the target. However, if the opponent is very close, the front leg can be used effectively to jam the oncoming opponent. The knee can also be used as a striking surface for the front kick if the distance to the target is very small. The front kick is best used for middle line targets, namely the groin and the abdomen, though it is extremely effective to the knee joint and the front kick to the face can be learned for more advanced or kickboxing-oriented persons. In comparison, the round kick can also be used to strike middle line targets but is best delivered to the side of the opponent in a circular trajectory. This kick can also be executed with the rear leg or the front leg and there is potential for a very powerful strike with the correct hip movement but it is unwise to use the round kick for the sole intention of unbalancing the opponent, as quite often it will leave the user open to attack. Finally, the snap kick can be effectively executed with the rear or front leg and can be used to drive through a target with the ball or heel of the foot. This kick is most effective for uprooting a charging opponent and is best targeted at the knee. All these kicks are best trained by striking a sandbag and are essential basic kicks for any martial artist to learn. 2.3. Blocks and parries Blocks are the primary method of absorbing an attack and are executed using the body or a limb to intercept the oncoming strike. Parries are a method of redirecting an attack by using an opposing force against itself with the intention of making the attacker miss their target. Blocks and parries have the dual function of protecting oneself and also creating an opening to counterattack. Against a punch, the most effective block is done on the inside of the attacking arm using the forearm to make contact with the puncher's upper arm. This will effectively jam up the attacker's arm and prevent him from further attacking with that limb. The effectiveness of using a parry against a punch is generally less because of the speed of the attack. However, a parry to the outside of the punch using an open hand can create a large opening for a counterattack. When blocking a kick, the aim is to intercept the kicking leg with an attack of your own, preferably to the attacker's standing leg to unbalance them. This can be a risky maneuver as the block can be mistimed and cause damage to the defender. So, it is also effective to use a parry to the inside of the attacking leg using an open hand. This can steer the direction of the kick away from the defender, causing a clean miss with no damage incurred. This can be particularly effective when defending against a knee strike due to the proximity of the attack to the defender. Using an arm to redirect the knee strike can easily create an opening for a counterattack. Blocks and parries are essential tools for self-defense and, when mastered, can turn an opponent's attack into their own demise. 3. Advanced Self-Defense Techniques Joint locks and submissions are effective in immobilizing an attacker or opponent. A joint lock is a maneuver that hyperextends, dislocates, or hyperflexes a joint, thereby causing an injury. Joint locks are usually used to control the actions of the opponent who is attacking or the aggressor. There are many types of joint locks; here are some of them. The straight arm bar is a lock that hyperextends the elbow joint, thus it can cause damage to the elbow joint. The wrist lock is a typical Aikido move that can hyperflex the wrist joint or, in some cases, also cause damage to the joint. A shoulder lock, such as the Omoplata, is used to cause an injury to the rotator cuff or to hyperextend the shoulder, causing the opponent not to be able to use his arm effectively. Thus, by using joint locks and submissions, an individual can control an attacker effectively without any significant harm to him. Joint locks also come under an escalation of force model that one can use to assess the amount of force required to handle a particular situation. When faced with multiple attackers or a one-on-one situation on the street, it is best to use throwing and taking down an opponent as quickly as possible. The idea is to get the fight to the ground where there is less chance of injury and where the grappler has a significant advantage over his opponent. This is also effective in situations where criminals attempt to use wrestling shoes and purses, but like most self-defense situations, throw and takedown is primarily researched due to its effectiveness in a real fight and the fact that it can be used as an offensive and defensive tactic. During a violent encounter, it is best to use offensive throws or throws that result in a neutral position. In the course of the opponent's fall, a grappler can use a solid fall to take a mount or back position. This can be further achieved with the use of Judo, which is an effective means of self-defense in that it is relatively easy to attain a solid understanding of the basics. Statistics in the UK show that the average Judo player can successfully attain a throw or takedown on an untrained opponent 9 times out of 10. 3.1. Joint locks and submissions Unconsolidated self-defense techniques focus on endeavors to immobilize your opponent or render their attempts to hurt you ineffective. Joint locks are usually a combination of using optimal leverage and angle on a joint to cause it to lock in a certain position, and using a hold to apply pressure in such a way that it causes pain. The result is that your opponent will be unable to follow up on an attack or will be so preoccupied with the pain that it will be relatively easy for you to control them. Joint locks can be applied to nearly any joint of the body but in the context of self-defense the primary targets are the wrist, elbow, knee, and shoulder, focusing on wrist locks due to their simplicity and the fact that control of the opponent's hands usually determines the course of action in a violent encounter. The most effective way to control a person who is attacking you is to put them in a submissive position where they are physically unable to continue their attack. Due to the potentially excessive damage that joint locks can cause including torn tendons and ligaments or broken bones, it's important to be extremely careful in training with joint locks only using them with high levels of control. This can still be insufficient if the other person doesn't know how to react to the joint locks being applied to prevent injury, so it is advised to practice joint locks on a resisting opponent of equal knowledge in technique, allowing both the person applying the lock and the opponent to learn what to do in the situation. 3.2. Throws and takedowns Throws can be a dangerous strategy for self-defense, considering the fact that you are taking a chance at dropping your attacker onto a hard surface and incurring his/her anger and further attacks. However, it is an important part of martial art as it builds confidence in your ability to off-balance an opponent and can minimize the severity of a situation should you be forced into a physical encounter. Throws can be effectively utilized, particularly in situations where the defender is outnumbered. It is a good strategy to attempt a throw on the first attacker and then try to run. A good martial artist should not only be able to recognize the advantages of throws and use them to his/her benefit but also know how to defend against them. This is why it is crucial for martial artists to learn break-falls. A good break fall can mean the difference between life and death should you be taken by surprise. If you can stay conscious after being thrown hard, the likelihood of your attacker pressing his/her advantage to finish you off is very high. By using a break fall and recovering quickly, you can prevent further attack and possibly reverse the situation. Remember that rolling during a fall will disperse the force of impact and lessen the chances of injury. Always keep your chin to your chest and make sure to exhale as you hit the ground. On every ground technique a martial artist performs, he/she should aim to throw with control, causing minimum damage to the opponent and should always be prepared to react if the situation changes or gets out of hand. Step or body through shoulder throws are the best throws to use in self-defense situations. The goal is to break your opponent's posture and set him/her up to be thrown. When practicing throws, always spend an equal amount of time training as Uke (the person receiving the technique), this will enable you to see and correct your mistakes from your partner's point of view. A skilled Uke will know how to fall safely; however, it is the Tori's (person performing the technique) responsibility to ensure that Uke is safe from injury. Takedowns are a safer alternative to throws and are very effective if the defender is being rushed or grabbed hold of. Like throws, it is a good idea to practice takedowns both to enable you to perform the technique and defend against it. 3.3. Escapes and counters Escapes refer to the self-defense moves that can be used to get out of a compromising position. This could be when someone has grabbed the defender, or taken them to the ground. These moves are an essential part of self-defense, as being able to escape from a compromising position can prevent the situation from escalating further. If successful in their escape, the defender will have taken the attacker back to square one, into a position where they can pre-empt a potentially violent confrontation, without having to resort to using excessive force. Drills involving escapes can be practiced dynamically at full speed and force, where the attacker uses realistic holds or grips, allowing the defender to develop the ability to react effectively and adapt the escape move to the given situation. Counters refer to the self-defense techniques that are used to nullify an attack and gain the initiative. A counter is effective if it prevents the attacker from following up his attack, and allows the defender to take the initiative. Good counters should enable the defender to switch to an attack of their own, where the situation has been reversed and the attacker is now on the defensive. Escapes and counters are common to all martial arts. However, most martial arts place too much emphasis on learning techniques to use in a contest, and neglect to practice these essential self-defense principles. This can lead to martial artists being over-confident in their ability to defend themselves in a real situation, where the primary goal is to escape without harm. 3.4. Weapon disarms \"They are rarely taken up by people who are worried about the possibility of being attacked, and those who take them up often do not continue training for very long; perhaps because they have achieved what they set out to do. This is not the issue for many assaults and attacks are not a one-time occurrence, it is reasonable to presume that if a person is caught once they will be attacked again. Or the nature of their attack or occupation leaves them highly susceptible to attack. It is for these people that martial arts are invaluable; even a small amount of training can be a huge help when focused on a specific aspect of a martial art and applied to a self-defense situation. Weapon disarms are usually an aspect of an advanced martial art, and are often overlooked by those beginning a martial art for self-defense. This is a mistake as weapons are often involved in very serious assaults on people and being held at knifepoint or similar is something that training has prepared many people for and they have managed to escape unscathed due to their art. Given the difficulty of such situations it is preferable to have encountered something of this nature within a training environment as an initial encounter could have a highly traumatic effect.\" 4. Self-Defense Strategies and Tactics The concept of a strategy encompasses the planning and decision making that precedes an event. Tactics, by contrast, deal with the actual physical activities involved in implementing a strategy and achieving a successful outcome. Sun Tzu, author of The Art of War, is often cited as an authority on the subject of strategy and tactics. He defined a war of strategy as one that is waged in the minds of the combatants as much as on the battlefield, one where the goal is to outthink the adversary and force a change in his preconceptions or perceptions of a situation. A war of tactics, by contrast, is defined as one of movement and conflict, with successful tactics meaning the effective positioning and actual fighting of units to destroy the enemy's ability to fight and win the battle or engagement of any kind. At the strategic level, one must always be looking to gain an advantage for the next tactical encounter. On losing ground, a tactician's attitude must change to that of hoping to force an error in the enemy camp to regain the lost ground. This understanding of strategy and tactics is completely relevant to the martial artist or self-defense practitioner. Too many martial arts schools and self-defense courses focus solely on the physical techniques that constitute the tactics of a violent encounter, without ever addressing the circumstances of violence, how to prevent it, and whether or not it's right to engage in it. A local bar brawl or a mugging in a dark alley require completely different sets of tactics, and regardless of the level of force to be used in each, a person must address whether the force is worth using at all. This is where strategy comes into play. But what are the strategies of self-defense, and how can a person learn to pick the best one in any situation? Today, the subject is massive and cannot be completely addressed in a work of this scope, but some clarity can at least be given towards types of strategy and planning, ways and means to damage the opponent, and the ever-shifting priorities between them. 4.1. Situational awareness and threat assessment Situational awareness is knowing what is happening around you. It is an important tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of others. There are a few key points to developing an effective situational awareness. The first is to be able to recognize when you are in a potentially dangerous situation. Most people have a gut feeling when something is not right. They get tense and nervous, hairs on the back of their neck stand up, or they get a feeling of unease. These feelings are caused by the body's adrenaline being released and are the body's natural defense mechanism. Unfortunately, many people ignore these feelings and continue with what they are doing and the feeling goes away. This can be very dangerous if the feeling was caused by an actual threat. The key then is to tune into how you are feeling in different situations and learning to recognize your body's natural signals. If you are in a situation where you are feeling nervous or tense, take a moment to stop and think about why you are feeling that way. What is it about the situation that is causing you to feel that way? The answers will usually be that something is out of place and does not feel right. At this point it is best to remove yourself from the situation and avoid it in the future. The next point is understanding the difference between social and asocial violence. Social violence is a spontaneous, emotional and relatively unorganized act committed with the intent to improve one's social standing. It is not necessarily carried out by people who are violent by nature and often social violence is committed by people who would not normally be considered violent. An example would be a confrontation between teenagers over an insult or a bar brawl. Asocial violence by comparison is committed by those who are naturally violent or criminal and is a means to an end. It is calculating, predatory and carried out with a purpose whether it is robbery, rape, a political assassination or a terror attack. Understanding the difference between the two is important, it is generally easier to avoid situations that may lead to social violence and it can be prevented by defusing the situation and swallowing one's pride. Asocial violence however is best avoided by simply not being there when and where it happens. Measures to be taken to avoid social violence depend on the situation and the individual. In a confrontation, swallowing your pride, being polite, respectful and swallowing your pride are often enough to avoid a violent situation and it will actually habituate a mindset for humility that can help in violent confrontations. 4.2. Verbal de-escalation techniques Remaining calm when threatened can be a tough thing to do, but sometimes the best defense is a good offense. Aggressive stances, facial expressions, yelling, and threats can all be forms of fighting that can be quelled without any physical contact. Using \"verbal judo\" can be compared to a sparring match. You use timing and technique to throw, block, and redirect your opponent. Trying to make an aggressor tired, and get them to disengage can also be very effective. While tired may have negative connotations, it is not necessarily a bad thing to tire someone who is bent on doing you harm. You are striving for control, and to place them in a submissive position. There is a seven part strategy to make sense of when / when not to talk. Stay focused on your goal \u2013 If you've chosen to talk, avoid acting in anger or humiliation. Avoid Engaging an Ego \u2013 Swallow your pride. Let them \"save face.\" Do not Lecture an Unwilling Student \u2013 Some people don't want to hear what you have to say. Do not be Sucked into their Frame \u2013 If you feel angry or upset, you're no longer in control of the situation. Know Your Audience \u2013 Understand who you're talking to and what the likely outcome will be. The above four points are more related to someone in a teaching or counseling situation, but very much apply to self-defense in avoiding a physical confrontation. Now the focus shifts to situations of potential life and death, and should carry a more serious weight. Set a clear limit \u2013 Let the person know exactly what will happen if they cross the line. This next example comes from Rory Miller, who is a correctional officer and has had extreme exposure to violence. 4.3. Multiple attackers and ground fighting This is a research paper summarizing the different strategies and tactics one could employ to ensure successful self-defense. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of said tactics and strategies, and will also rate the level of difficulty each may involve. The strategies and tactics which will be evaluated include situational awareness, verbal de-escalation, ground fighting, and the laws surrounding self-defense situations. The multiple attacker assault is one of the hardest situations to defend oneself from. As you can be the best striker or grappler around, it is difficult to defend against multiple people successfully. Usually, when we face multiple situations, the main goal is to defeat the primary target or take care of it to the best of our ability. From here, we intend to disengage and escape to a safe area. This might be the best plan for beginners because you are successful if you escape and can revise the poor situation to attempt to make it better. Since the multiple attacker assault can take place anywhere from on the street to a crowded bar or pub, it is best as a self-defense situation to avoid this scenario. This can often be done by using your best judgment to prevent being in the wrong place at the wrong time or avoiding the people or places known to provoke multiple attack situations. 4.4. Legal considerations and self-defense laws Legislation is one of the most contentious areas of self-defence. The law is complex and varies considerably from country to country. Most often, it is down to the decision of a jury in court to decide whether or not force used in self-defence was reasonable. There are laws in place to protect a person who uses force as an act of self-defence, providing they can prove that there was a genuine threat to their safety. A person can use reasonable force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime. If force is used, it must be reasonable in the circumstances. There is no clear definition about what is considered reasonable. This is because the law seeks to avoid an exact definition that would cover all circumstances. The force used in self-defence must always be proportional to the threat. If the situation involves an armed attack, it is not considered reasonable to use an equal level of physical force to defend oneself.

Introduction Self defense is the right to prevent suffering force or violence through the use of a sufficient level of counteracting force or violence. It is defined as the act of defending one\u2019s person when physically attacked, but also of defending oneself from any action that can cause harm to a person. This includes all acts of violence, ranging from nonaggressive to aggressive behavior. Self defense is protecting ourselves from people who have intentions of harming us. The interesting thing about self defense is that many of us have never had formal training on how to protect ourselves. Formal training is defined as taking courses in self defense or martial arts. This type of training allows one to learn the skills needed to defend him or herself. Many people believe that they can defend themselves simply by \"fighting dirty\". This is conclusion such as \"I would kick him in the balls and run\". While this is an effective way of protecting you, there are legal implications to every action taken. Taking formal training allows one to understand different laws in defense and the correct way of defending yourself without causing harm to others. Self defense can come in a variety of ways. This can range from physical, mental, or spiritual needs to defend oneself. An example of spiritual self defense would be refraining from an argument when you know it's not worth your time or energy. Mental self defense is using your mind to find ways to avoid certain situations or conflicts that can lead to harm. An example of mental defense is analyzing whether or not a situation is safe and choosing the best way to remove yourself from that situation. Physical self defense is the most common and most important way to defend oneself. This is the use of physical force to counter an immediate threat of violence. This can range from something as simple as using your hands to move an aggressor away from you or to striking someone with the intention of injury or de-escalating a threat. This is where training in martial arts can play an important role in self defense. Using physical self defense, a person under the threat of injury needs only to demonstrate intent to cause the aggressor to fear harmful force, and if the circumstances are sufficient, it will count as self defense if he uses force to disarm the aggressor. Self defense encompasses a wide range of things, it is not devolved or set around physical combat alone. 1.1. Definition of self-defense Self-defense is a countermeasure that involves defending the health and well-being of oneself from harm. The use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times of danger is available in many jurisdictions, but the interpretation varies widely. Physical self-defense is the use of physical force to counter an immediate threat of violence. Such force can be either armed or unarmed. In either case, the chances of success are seriously compromised if the person does not understand the physical force that is being used against him or her. It is often best to attempt to neutralize the attack with a use of force that is equal or lesser in strength. Attempts to neutralize the attack which involve a greater strength can cause more damage than good. It is also important to consider the relative strength of the assailant, because if the assailant is a professional boxer and you have experience in wrestling, striking the assailant might not be the best choice. Simulation of the techniques used in real self-defense involve training in combatives, practicing sparring skills, and the development of situational awareness.

Importance of self-defense in martial arts Self-defense techniques, specifically in martial arts, are very significant because the skills are based on protecting the person and other individuals on their own from physical harm. Self-defense training focuses on making the safest outcome when put in a situation where one is forced to protect themselves by using techniques effectively. Impact training often has a mental and physical state for the person practicing the art. There are many reasons why learning self-defense techniques is important for the mental and physical well-being of an individual. Self-defense techniques can enhance one's mental and physical health. Practicing martial arts is one of the best ways to learn and improve self-defense techniques. Self-defense techniques in martial arts will be the most effective way to learn the proper skills in protection and survival. Learning to effectively block, evade, and intercept an attack are the key concepts to a successful defense. Mastering these skills can be very difficult and takes a lot of training and patience. Learning and utilizing self-defense techniques can also give a person confidence and peace of mind. This is because they will feel secure in their ability to protect themselves and loved ones when put into a dangerous situation. Feeling safe and secure will lead to a clear and stress-free mind, which is very healthy for an individual. Having confidence itself can sometimes deter an attacker or prevent a situation from becoming hostile. Since the martial artist has confidence in his ability to defend himself, he will not feel the need to escalate a situation to violence. This can result in fewer physical confrontations with others. An important idea to understand is that a person can never predict when something dangerous may happen to them. Usually, people do not want to think about hazardous situations, but it is wise to be prepared and have a plan of action. This is where self-defense training comes into play. The skills learned are a preventative measure to stop a bad situation from getting worse. This can range from anything such as being aware of your surroundings in a potentially hostile environment, to completely avoiding dangerous situations. In some cases, the best self-defense is to run away and remove oneself from a dangerous situation. 2. Basic Self-Defense Techniques Punching is about getting your arm to extend rapidly and efficiently. With body motion, weight shifting, and extending the arm, you are able to increase the power of the punch, offering an effective and forceful blow. There are many different types of punches, each having a specific purpose. The jab punch is used to control or dominate the opponent. It is fast, and the lead hand does the majority of the work. The cross punch is used for more power and damage. The rear hand (stronger hand, if you are right-handed this would be your right hand, and if you are left-handed it is your left hand) gives a right straight punch, extending the body and making sure that the entire weight at the time is shifted to the back foot to give the power for the punch. The hook punch is used to slice to the opponent's head from a side angle. It is a hard punch used to cause a knockout. The hook punch is similar to the uppercut punch, which is used to strike upwards and to the head, which can also cause a knockout. An elbow strike is a close strike from the opponent with a bent arm. The elbow can be used for the majority of the strikes with the intention of causing heavy damage and pain. Elbows are used for striking from grapple/clinch situations and are also used as counter strikes. Elbows are great for self-defense because they are strong and simple to execute. Mitigating the damage from an opponent's strike, it is important to be able to block the strike. This can be executed using the hands/forearms to cover the head, or you could perform a defensive body movement to avoid the strike. In cases where there is no escape, it is effective to use a block with a counter strike with the intention of nullifying the opponent's attack. A counter strike is a strike executed while the opponent is preparing or executing an attack. This will, in effect, disrupt the opponent's rhythm and tempo as well as causing damage. This can be achieved using many different strikes and is a highly effective self-defense technique. 2.1. Punches and strikes Fist fights are common aspects of self-defense encounters. Here are some strikes that will increase your effectiveness in a fight. When punching, try to focus on the large part of the body such as the chest area and stomach. This is because the more distance between your fist and the opponent's head, the more time the opponent has to react and counter your strike. By focusing on the large part of the body, if your punch is effectively landed, it can cause internal damage to the opponent and will likely immobilize them, giving you time to create distance and escape. Normally, the most common punch is the jab. The jab is quick and is a good way to measure the distance between you and your opponent. This is an important aspect of combat. For instance, if your opponent has a longer reach than you and stays at a distance, without being able to measure the distance, it will be hard to close the gap and get into a position where it is possible for you to hit your opponent but your opponent cannot hit you. The best way to measure your distance is to let the opponent initiate an attack and when they are in range of hitting you, back out so the attack falls short of you. If you stay in this range and practice parrying a few times, you will learn that it is enough room to still be able to counterattack. 2.2. Kicks and knee strikes A kick is one of the most powerful strikes that can be delivered. Kicks can drive through a target, or break it, depending on the intention of the user. It is effectively used as a counter to other strikes, a vital part of ground fighting and most of all the foundation of all aerial techniques. Unfortunately, in a real self-defense situation, the user is often wearing heavy footwear and the target area may be small. This means that a mistimed or inaccurate kick may result in the user injuring themselves or missing the target completely. Therefore, it is essential for the user to learn the basic kicks and knee strikes and train in lighter footwear to ensure that the strikes can be executed rapidly and accurately. One of the most useful kicks in a self-defense situation is the front kick. It is a linear kick with the knee and foot aligned to the target. The sole of the foot is the part of the foot intended to strike the target but in the case of the legs giving way, the ball of the foot can be used. The rear leg is often the best to use because it can be pre-loaded and explode into the target. However, if the opponent is very close, the front leg can be used effectively to jam the oncoming opponent. The knee can also be used as a striking surface for the front kick if the distance to the target is very small. The front kick is best used for middle line targets, namely the groin and the abdomen, though it is extremely effective to the knee joint and the front kick to the face can be learned for more advanced or kickboxing-oriented persons. In comparison, the round kick can also be used to strike middle line targets but is best delivered to the side of the opponent in a circular trajectory. This kick can also be executed with the rear leg or the front leg and there is potential for a very powerful strike with the correct hip movement but it is unwise to use the round kick for the sole intention of unbalancing the opponent, as quite often it will leave the user open to attack. Finally, the snap kick can be effectively executed with the rear or front leg and can be used to drive through a target with the ball or heel of the foot. This kick is most effective for uprooting a charging opponent and is best targeted at the knee. All these kicks are best trained by striking a sandbag and are essential basic kicks for any martial artist to learn. 2.3. Blocks and parries Blocks are the primary method of absorbing an attack and are executed using the body or a limb to intercept the oncoming strike. Parries are a method of redirecting an attack by using an opposing force against itself with the intention of making the attacker miss their target. Blocks and parries have the dual function of protecting oneself and also creating an opening to counterattack. Against a punch, the most effective block is done on the inside of the attacking arm using the forearm to make contact with the puncher's upper arm. This will effectively jam up the attacker's arm and prevent him from further attacking with that limb. The effectiveness of using a parry against a punch is generally less because of the speed of the attack. However, a parry to the outside of the punch using an open hand can create a large opening for a counterattack. When blocking a kick, the aim is to intercept the kicking leg with an attack of your own, preferably to the attacker's standing leg to unbalance them. This can be a risky maneuver as the block can be mistimed and cause damage to the defender. So, it is also effective to use a parry to the inside of the attacking leg using an open hand. This can steer the direction of the kick away from the defender, causing a clean miss with no damage incurred. This can be particularly effective when defending against a knee strike due to the proximity of the attack to the defender. Using an arm to redirect the knee strike can easily create an opening for a counterattack. Blocks and parries are essential tools for self-defense and, when mastered, can turn an opponent's attack into their own demise. 3. Advanced Self-Defense Techniques Joint locks and submissions are effective in immobilizing an attacker or opponent. A joint lock is a maneuver that hyperextends, dislocates, or hyperflexes a joint, thereby causing an injury. Joint locks are usually used to control the actions of the opponent who is attacking or the aggressor. There are many types of joint locks; here are some of them. The straight arm bar is a lock that hyperextends the elbow joint, thus it can cause damage to the elbow joint. The wrist lock is a typical Aikido move that can hyperflex the wrist joint or, in some cases, also cause damage to the joint. A shoulder lock, such as the Omoplata, is used to cause an injury to the rotator cuff or to hyperextend the shoulder, causing the opponent not to be able to use his arm effectively. Thus, by using joint locks and submissions, an individual can control an attacker effectively without any significant harm to him. Joint locks also come under an escalation of force model that one can use to assess the amount of force required to handle a particular situation. When faced with multiple attackers or a one-on-one situation on the street, it is best to use throwing and taking down an opponent as quickly as possible. The idea is to get the fight to the ground where there is less chance of injury and where the grappler has a significant advantage over his opponent. This is also effective in situations where criminals attempt to use wrestling shoes and purses, but like most self-defense situations, throw and takedown is primarily researched due to its effectiveness in a real fight and the fact that it can be used as an offensive and defensive tactic. During a violent encounter, it is best to use offensive throws or throws that result in a neutral position. In the course of the opponent's fall, a grappler can use a solid fall to take a mount or back position. This can be further achieved with the use of Judo, which is an effective means of self-defense in that it is relatively easy to attain a solid understanding of the basics. Statistics in the UK show that the average Judo player can successfully attain a throw or takedown on an untrained opponent 9 times out of 10. 3.1. Joint locks and submissions Unconsolidated self-defense techniques focus on endeavors to immobilize your opponent or render their attempts to hurt you ineffective. Joint locks are usually a combination of using optimal leverage and angle on a joint to cause it to lock in a certain position, and using a hold to apply pressure in such a way that it causes pain. The result is that your opponent will be unable to follow up on an attack or will be so preoccupied with the pain that it will be relatively easy for you to control them. Joint locks can be applied to nearly any joint of the body but in the context of self-defense the primary targets are the wrist, elbow, knee, and shoulder, focusing on wrist locks due to their simplicity and the fact that control of the opponent's hands usually determines the course of action in a violent encounter. The most effective way to control a person who is attacking you is to put them in a submissive position where they are physically unable to continue their attack. Due to the potentially excessive damage that joint locks can cause including torn tendons and ligaments or broken bones, it's important to be extremely careful in training with joint locks only using them with high levels of control. This can still be insufficient if the other person doesn't know how to react to the joint locks being applied to prevent injury, so it is advised to practice joint locks on a resisting opponent of equal knowledge in technique, allowing both the person applying the lock and the opponent to learn what to do in the situation. 3.2. Throws and takedowns Throws can be a dangerous strategy for self-defense, considering the fact that you are taking a chance at dropping your attacker onto a hard surface and incurring his/her anger and further attacks. However, it is an important part of martial art as it builds confidence in your ability to off-balance an opponent and can minimize the severity of a situation should you be forced into a physical encounter. Throws can be effectively utilized, particularly in situations where the defender is outnumbered. It is a good strategy to attempt a throw on the first attacker and then try to run. A good martial artist should not only be able to recognize the advantages of throws and use them to his/her benefit but also know how to defend against them. This is why it is crucial for martial artists to learn break-falls. A good break fall can mean the difference between life and death should you be taken by surprise. If you can stay conscious after being thrown hard, the likelihood of your attacker pressing his/her advantage to finish you off is very high. By using a break fall and recovering quickly, you can prevent further attack and possibly reverse the situation. Remember that rolling during a fall will disperse the force of impact and lessen the chances of injury. Always keep your chin to your chest and make sure to exhale as you hit the ground. On every ground technique a martial artist performs, he/she should aim to throw with control, causing minimum damage to the opponent and should always be prepared to react if the situation changes or gets out of hand. Step or body through shoulder throws are the best throws to use in self-defense situations. The goal is to break your opponent's posture and set him/her up to be thrown. When practicing throws, always spend an equal amount of time training as Uke (the person receiving the technique), this will enable you to see and correct your mistakes from your partner's point of view. A skilled Uke will know how to fall safely; however, it is the Tori's (person performing the technique) responsibility to ensure that Uke is safe from injury. Takedowns are a safer alternative to throws and are very effective if the defender is being rushed or grabbed hold of. Like throws, it is a good idea to practice takedowns both to enable you to perform the technique and defend against it. 3.3. Escapes and counters Escapes refer to the self-defense moves that can be used to get out of a compromising position. This could be when someone has grabbed the defender, or taken them to the ground. These moves are an essential part of self-defense, as being able to escape from a compromising position can prevent the situation from escalating further. If successful in their escape, the defender will have taken the attacker back to square one, into a position where they can pre-empt a potentially violent confrontation, without having to resort to using excessive force. Drills involving escapes can be practiced dynamically at full speed and force, where the attacker uses realistic holds or grips, allowing the defender to develop the ability to react effectively and adapt the escape move to the given situation. Counters refer to the self-defense techniques that are used to nullify an attack and gain the initiative. A counter is effective if it prevents the attacker from following up his attack, and allows the defender to take the initiative. Good counters should enable the defender to switch to an attack of their own, where the situation has been reversed and the attacker is now on the defensive. Escapes and counters are common to all martial arts. However, most martial arts place too much emphasis on learning techniques to use in a contest, and neglect to practice these essential self-defense principles. This can lead to martial artists being over-confident in their ability to defend themselves in a real situation, where the primary goal is to escape without harm. 3.4. Weapon disarms \"They are rarely taken up by people who are worried about the possibility of being attacked, and those who take them up often do not continue training for very long; perhaps because they have achieved what they set out to do. This is not the issue for many assaults and attacks are not a one-time occurrence, it is reasonable to presume that if a person is caught once they will be attacked again. Or the nature of their attack or occupation leaves them highly susceptible to attack. It is for these people that martial arts are invaluable; even a small amount of training can be a huge help when focused on a specific aspect of a martial art and applied to a self-defense situation. Weapon disarms are usually an aspect of an advanced martial art, and are often overlooked by those beginning a martial art for self-defense. This is a mistake as weapons are often involved in very serious assaults on people and being held at knifepoint or similar is something that training has prepared many people for and they have managed to escape unscathed due to their art. Given the difficulty of such situations it is preferable to have encountered something of this nature within a training environment as an initial encounter could have a highly traumatic effect.\" 4. Self-Defense Strategies and Tactics The concept of a strategy encompasses the planning and decision making that precedes an event. Tactics, by contrast, deal with the actual physical activities involved in implementing a strategy and achieving a successful outcome. Sun Tzu, author of The Art of War, is often cited as an authority on the subject of strategy and tactics. He defined a war of strategy as one that is waged in the minds of the combatants as much as on the battlefield, one where the goal is to outthink the adversary and force a change in his preconceptions or perceptions of a situation. A war of tactics, by contrast, is defined as one of movement and conflict, with successful tactics meaning the effective positioning and actual fighting of units to destroy the enemy's ability to fight and win the battle or engagement of any kind. At the strategic level, one must always be looking to gain an advantage for the next tactical encounter. On losing ground, a tactician's attitude must change to that of hoping to force an error in the enemy camp to regain the lost ground. This understanding of strategy and tactics is completely relevant to the martial artist or self-defense practitioner. Too many martial arts schools and self-defense courses focus solely on the physical techniques that constitute the tactics of a violent encounter, without ever addressing the circumstances of violence, how to prevent it, and whether or not it's right to engage in it. A local bar brawl or a mugging in a dark alley require completely different sets of tactics, and regardless of the level of force to be used in each, a person must address whether the force is worth using at all. This is where strategy comes into play. But what are the strategies of self-defense, and how can a person learn to pick the best one in any situation? Today, the subject is massive and cannot be completely addressed in a work of this scope, but some clarity can at least be given towards types of strategy and planning, ways and means to damage the opponent, and the ever-shifting priorities between them. 4.1. Situational awareness and threat assessment Situational awareness is knowing what is happening around you. It is an important tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of others. There are a few key points to developing an effective situational awareness. The first is to be able to recognize when you are in a potentially dangerous situation. Most people have a gut feeling when something is not right. They get tense and nervous, hairs on the back of their neck stand up, or they get a feeling of unease. These feelings are caused by the body's adrenaline being released and are the body's natural defense mechanism. Unfortunately, many people ignore these feelings and continue with what they are doing and the feeling goes away. This can be very dangerous if the feeling was caused by an actual threat. The key then is to tune into how you are feeling in different situations and learning to recognize your body's natural signals. If you are in a situation where you are feeling nervous or tense, take a moment to stop and think about why you are feeling that way. What is it about the situation that is causing you to feel that way? The answers will usually be that something is out of place and does not feel right. At this point it is best to remove yourself from the situation and avoid it in the future. The next point is understanding the difference between social and asocial violence. Social violence is a spontaneous, emotional and relatively unorganized act committed with the intent to improve one's social standing. It is not necessarily carried out by people who are violent by nature and often social violence is committed by people who would not normally be considered violent. An example would be a confrontation between teenagers over an insult or a bar brawl. Asocial violence by comparison is committed by those who are naturally violent or criminal and is a means to an end. It is calculating, predatory and carried out with a purpose whether it is robbery, rape, a political assassination or a terror attack. Understanding the difference between the two is important, it is generally easier to avoid situations that may lead to social violence and it can be prevented by defusing the situation and swallowing one's pride. Asocial violence however is best avoided by simply not being there when and where it happens. Measures to be taken to avoid social violence depend on the situation and the individual. In a confrontation, swallowing your pride, being polite, respectful and swallowing your pride are often enough to avoid a violent situation and it will actually habituate a mindset for humility that can help in violent confrontations. 4.2. Verbal de-escalation techniques Remaining calm when threatened can be a tough thing to do, but sometimes the best defense is a good offense. Aggressive stances, facial expressions, yelling, and threats can all be forms of fighting that can be quelled without any physical contact. Using \"verbal judo\" can be compared to a sparring match. You use timing and technique to throw, block, and redirect your opponent. Trying to make an aggressor tired, and get them to disengage can also be very effective. While tired may have negative connotations, it is not necessarily a bad thing to tire someone who is bent on doing you harm. You are striving for control, and to place them in a submissive position. There is a seven part strategy to make sense of when / when not to talk. Stay focused on your goal \u2013 If you've chosen to talk, avoid acting in anger or humiliation. Avoid Engaging an Ego \u2013 Swallow your pride. Let them \"save face.\" Do not Lecture an Unwilling Student \u2013 Some people don't want to hear what you have to say. Do not be Sucked into their Frame \u2013 If you feel angry or upset, you're no longer in control of the situation. Know Your Audience \u2013 Understand who you're talking to and what the likely outcome will be. The above four points are more related to someone in a teaching or counseling situation, but very much apply to self-defense in avoiding a physical confrontation. Now the focus shifts to situations of potential life and death, and should carry a more serious weight. Set a clear limit \u2013 Let the person know exactly what will happen if they cross the line. This next example comes from Rory Miller, who is a correctional officer and has had extreme exposure to violence. 4.3. Multiple attackers and ground fighting This is a research paper summarizing the different strategies and tactics one could employ to ensure successful self-defense. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of said tactics and strategies, and will also rate the level of difficulty each may involve. The strategies and tactics which will be evaluated include situational awareness, verbal de-escalation, ground fighting, and the laws surrounding self-defense situations. The multiple attacker assault is one of the hardest situations to defend oneself from. As you can be the best striker or grappler around, it is difficult to defend against multiple people successfully. Usually, when we face multiple situations, the main goal is to defeat the primary target or take care of it to the best of our ability. From here, we intend to disengage and escape to a safe area. This might be the best plan for beginners because you are successful if you escape and can revise the poor situation to attempt to make it better. Since the multiple attacker assault can take place anywhere from on the street to a crowded bar or pub, it is best as a self-defense situation to avoid this scenario. This can often be done by using your best judgment to prevent being in the wrong place at the wrong time or avoiding the people or places known to provoke multiple attack situations. 4.4. Legal considerations and self-defense laws Legislation is one of the most contentious areas of self-defence. The law is complex and varies considerably from country to country. Most often, it is down to the decision of a jury in court to decide whether or not force used in self-defence was reasonable. There are laws in place to protect a person who uses force as an act of self-defence, providing they can prove that there was a genuine threat to their safety. A person can use reasonable force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime. If force is used, it must be reasonable in the circumstances. There is no clear definition about what is considered reasonable. This is because the law seeks to avoid an exact definition that would cover all circumstances. The force used in self-defence must always be proportional to the threat. If the situation involves an armed attack, it is not considered reasonable to use an equal level of physical force to defend oneself.

Whether it's walking alone at night, using public transportation, or navigating unfamiliar environments, the importance of personal safety cannot be overstated. Women in particular face unique safety challenges, as they are disproportionately affected by various forms of gender-based violence such as sexual harassment, unwanted advances, and stalking. Some women are so disturbed by the prospect of this happening that they avoid certain areas. Thankfully, there are precautions we can take to feel safer. For example, understanding the dynamics that contribute to risky situations and knowing how to mitigate them is an invaluable tool for women\u2019s self-defense. Sometimes we can reduce the chances of crime occurring simply by changing our routine or by adding additional security measures. Central to this approach is the concept of situational awareness, which involves maintaining a state of vigilance in our surroundings, swiftly identifying potential threats, and having a clear understanding of how to respond to potential threats. This serves as the cornerstone of women's self-defense, greatly reinforcing personal safety in various everyday scenarios, be it navigating dimly lit streets or going about our routine activities. In this post, I\u2019ll explain why situational awareness is a critical part of women\u2019s self-defense, followed by some practical tips on how to feel safer in your everyday life. The Power of Awareness in Women\u2019s Self-Defense As a woman who often commutes to work on foot and extensively uses public transit, I can personally attest to encountering individuals who have made me, and many women like me, feel uneasy or unsafe.\u00a0 Many women I've spoken to about this topic have shared similar concerns, underscoring the prevalence of such experiences. I vividly remember one unsettling encounter that occurred when I was going to the metro station one night after work. The business district was quiet by that time with not many pedestrians around. However, there was a nearby cyclist who caught my attention due to his unusually slow pace, which was even slower than my walking speed.\u00a0 I decided to slow down even more, to which he did the same. My intuition signaled that something was off, and I confirmed my suspicions when I turned to see him uncomfortably staring. With no desire to find out his intentions, I sought refuge in an adjacent restaurant for about an hour or so. By the time I left, thankfully he had decided to move on. In such situations, being equipped with the right knowledge is instrumental in being able to recognize red flags in the environment and know how to react before the situation gets worse. In my personal experiences as a criminal justice researcher studying crime patterns and taking situational awareness and women\u2019s self-defense classes, I feel better equipped to recognize potential threats in the early stages and take proactive steps to buy time or exit the area. While this approach isn\u2019t foolproof, there is a reason why people say \u201can ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d The Relevance of Crime Patterns in Women\u2019s Self-Defense Strategy Recognizing these patterns and their relevance to everyday life provides a solid foundation for enhancing our situational awareness.\u00a0 Concepts like the and help explain how criminal opportunities arise and how they are often influenced by environmental and situational factors. For a crime to occur, three elements must converge in time and space: A Motivated Offender: This is someone who has the intent or desire to commit a crime. It could be a burglar, a robber, a vandal, or any individual with criminal intentions. Motivated offenders typically seek opportunities with maximum potential payoffs but minimal potential risks. Thus, they are usually selective when choosing the location, time, and target of their offense. A Suitable Target: In this context, \u201csuitable\u201d refers to characteristics of a potential target that make it more appealing to an offender. A suitable target is a person or property that is accessible to the offender and appears vulnerable or easy to victimize. Factors such as isolation, darkness, and the absence of witnesses or assistance can contribute to someone or something being seen as a suitable target.\u00a0 For example, an unattended vehicle may be seen as a suitable target for theft, while someone walking alone at night might be seen as a suitable target for robbery. Lack of Capable Guardian: Capable guardianship involves having people or security measures in place to protect a potential target or to intervene if a crime is attempted.\u00a0 For example, in a public space, law enforcement presence is a type of capable guardian. In a residential setting, a home security system or watchful neighbors can act as capable guardians. Personal self-defense tools such as pepper spray can also be considered a form of capable guardianship. When you are in a situation that lacks capable guardianship, you are more likely to be a victim. When these three elements converge, it creates a situation that is conducive to criminal behavior. But if you can eliminate one of these elements, it dramatically reduces the opportunity. There are a few ways to do this, but it generally involves either increasing the effort required, raising the risks involved, or decreasing the potential rewards. In other words, you can make it harder to become a target for a motivated offender. Target Suitability and Women\u2019s Self-Defense A key aspect in women\u2019s self-defense is learning how to reduce appeal to a potential offender. The suitability of a target can vary depending on the circumstances as well as the offender\u2019s perception of the circumstances. Generally, offenders look for someone who has something valuable that they want and who is conveniently reachable. They also tend to target individuals who appear vulnerable and easy to overpower. They want to commit the perfect crime, and they assess whether they want to increase their risk of getting hurt or caught by choosing you. If you act in a way that changes the perception that you are an easy victim, an offender might see you as a less worthy target and decide to focus their attention elsewhere. Here are some examples of ways that you can reduce your appeal to a potential offender: 1. Keep valuables out of sight This applies to valuables stored at home as well as those that you carry on your person. Avoid displaying expensive items such as jewelry or electronics in public. When getting cash from an ATM, put your money away before exiting the ATM kiosk so that your money isn\u2019t openly visible. Also, make sure to use ATMs that are in locked booths or kiosks. 2. Change your routine. If you often take the same route, consider changing it up from time to time. Offenders often seek out easy and predictable targets, and by breaking the routine, you make yourself less appealing as a potential victim. This decreases your likelihood of being targeted by an opportunistic offender who may have observed your habits. Similarly, be cautious about sharing information regarding your schedule on social media, as well as excessive geo-tagging, as these are common ways that an offender can become aware of your routine. 3. Use nonverbal cues that convey assertiveness. Certain and behaviors can decrease the chances that an offender will view you as an easy target. For example, offenders often look at one\u2019s to assess vulnerability. Walk with purpose and use strides that convey assertiveness, and match the pace of other pedestrians in the area. Hold your head high and maintain a confident posture. Avoid shuffling your feet as this can make you appear injured or impaired, and easier to overpower. 4. Avoid substances that can cloud your judgment. Consumption of alcohol or other substances can impair your judgment, reduce your awareness, and hamper your ability to . It also makes you appear more vulnerable to a potential offender, as you would likely be easier to overpower. If you do end up in this situation though, get a ride home with a trusted individual rather than walking or taking public transit. 5. Practice situational awareness. Pay attention to your surroundings. Avoid staring at your phone. If using headphones, use only one ear so that you can still hear things that are going on around you. You can also casually look around so that you are aware of the people in your environment. This gives your intuition a chance to sink in and reduces the opportunity for a surprise attack. You can also give people split-second glances: this sends a message of \u201cI see you. If you are up to no good, I am not an easy target.\u201d After losing the element of surprise, an offender will often go elsewhere. 6. Trust your gut. Most importantly, trust your instincts\u2014if something feels off or unsafe, leave the area or seek help. Learn routes where you could possibly run to if needed. Be aware of which businesses are open 24/7, or which buildings have 24/7 security. The Role of Capable Guardians in Women\u2019s Self-Defense Bolstering the presence of effective safeguards or capable guardians is also helping for women\u2019s self-defense as it increases the risks for a potential offender. If you can increase their chances of getting caught, or scare them into thinking that you pose a threat in some way, they may decide to go elsewhere. To enhance capable guardianship when in public spaces, here are some steps that you can take: 1. Stick to well-lit routes. Stick to routes that are well-lit and well-populated when walking and jogging, even if they are slightly longer. When taking public transportation, wait at well-lit stops. Similarly, if you are driving and need to pull over for some reason, look for a well-lit parking lot. 2. Strength in numbers. Travel in groups whenever possible, especially in the late night or early morning. If you take public transportation, try to sit near the driver. When traveling in a group, check in with your friends after parting ways to ensure that everyone got home safely. If you do travel alone, always let someone know your whereabouts and expected return time. 3. Be vigilant when meeting new people. If you are meeting up with someone who you are still getting to know, meet them in a public place the first few times. This also applies when meeting up with people from dating apps or from buying-and-selling apps. For the latter, if you are selling an expensive item, remember that it increases your vulnerability as a potential target. Consider meeting in a public place that is near a police station. Some police departments have designated \u201csafe trade spots\u201d for buying-and-selling apps that are free to use. To find one local to you, check out 4. Make use of technology. Familiarize yourself with emergency apps and phone features that would allow you to quickly call for help if needed. Additionally, there are a range of and wearable smart devices that offer geotagged alerts to , some even equipped with . You can also use non-emergency apps to enable continuous real-time GPS sharing with trusted contacts without the need for individual notifications. 5. Empower Yourself Consider taking women\u2019s self-defense classes to build confidence and learn techniques to in case of an emergency. You can also carry a personal safety device like pepper spray, a personal alarm, a whistle, or even an air horn. Remember, if you are selected as a target but you can put up a fight and draw attention, an offender may decide that you are not worth the risk and go elsewhere. Why Situational Awareness Matters for Women\u2019s Self-Defense After many years of martial arts training, one of the phrases that sticks with me the most is: \u201cthe only fight that you win is the one that you don\u2019t get in.\u201d In terms of women\u2019s self-defense, one of the best ways to avoid violence is through prevention. This is done by being cognizant of your surroundings, being able to identify when something doesn\u2019t look right, and knowing when to take preventive actions. Situational awareness helps you notice things that seem out of the ordinary or suspicious, allowing you to identify potential threats and take preemptive steps to avoid or mitigate potential danger. In our fast-paced world, where distractions abound and our attention is constantly divided, personal safety can sometimes take a backseat. But the truth is, being vigilant and aware of our surroundings is paramount for our safety. Situational awareness extends beyond women\u2019s self-defense and applies to everyday situations, including , ,\u00a0 and online safety, among others. To learn more about the benefits of situational awareness, check out our companion post: \u201c \u201d Empower Yourself Today with Situational Awareness Training You can't always deter a potential offender, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you are powerless. Regardless of the situation you are in, being aware of your surroundings can make all the difference in being able to in your environment, which is a crucial skill in women\u2019s self-defense strategies. Early recognition of potential threats is critical in being able to avoid or mitigate them. Situational awareness is a crucial skill, but it's not just an innate ability. At Second Sight, we understand the importance of staying safe and prepared, which is why we offer the Situational Awareness for Safety course tailored to help individuals, like you, enhance their awareness and make informed choices to protect themselves. I recently took Second Sight\u2019s one-hour online course, , which helped me hone and practice my observational and situational awareness skills. Through this course, I learned how to systematically assess any environment, recognize potential risks, and how to respond accordingly. These skills help me feel safer and more capable of navigating various situations, and I feel empowered that I would actually know how to react if faced with a threat. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to fellow women living in cities, frequent solo travelers, and anyone seeking to enhance their personal safety.

When you are in a situation that lacks capable guardianship, you are more likely to be a victim. When these three elements converge, it creates a situation that is conducive to criminal behavior. But if you can eliminate one of these elements, it dramatically reduces the opportunity. There are a few ways to do this, but it generally involves either increasing the effort required, raising the risks involved, or decreasing the potential rewards. In other words, you can make it harder to become a target for a motivated offender. Target Suitability and Women\u2019s Self-Defense A key aspect in women\u2019s self-defense is learning how to reduce appeal to a potential offender. The suitability of a target can vary depending on the circumstances as well as the offender\u2019s perception of the circumstances. Generally, offenders look for someone who has something valuable that they want and who is conveniently reachable. They also tend to target individuals who appear vulnerable and easy to overpower. They want to commit the perfect crime, and they assess whether they want to increase their risk of getting hurt or caught by choosing you. If you act in a way that changes the perception that you are an easy victim, an offender might see you as a less worthy target and decide to focus their attention elsewhere. Here are some examples of ways that you can reduce your appeal to a potential offender: 1. Keep valuables out of sight This applies to valuables stored at home as well as those that you carry on your person. Avoid displaying expensive items such as jewelry or electronics in public. When getting cash from an ATM, put your money away before exiting the ATM kiosk so that your money isn\u2019t openly visible. Also, make sure to use ATMs that are in locked booths or kiosks. 2. Change your routine. If you often take the same route, consider changing it up from time to time. Offenders often seek out easy and predictable targets, and by breaking the routine, you make yourself less appealing as a potential victim. This decreases your likelihood of being targeted by an opportunistic offender who may have observed your habits. Similarly, be cautious about sharing information regarding your schedule on social media, as well as excessive geo-tagging, as these are common ways that an offender can become aware of your routine. 3. Use nonverbal cues that convey assertiveness. Certain and behaviors can decrease the chances that an offender will view you as an easy target. For example, offenders often look at one\u2019s to assess vulnerability. Walk with purpose and use strides that convey assertiveness, and match the pace of other pedestrians in the area. Hold your head high and maintain a confident posture.  Avoid shuffling your feet as this can make you appear injured or impaired, and easier to overpower. 4. Avoid substances that can cloud your judgment. Consumption of alcohol or other substances can impair your judgment, reduce your awareness, and hamper your ability to . It also makes you appear more vulnerable to a potential offender, as you would likely be easier to overpower. If you do end up in this situation though, get a ride home with a trusted individual rather than walking or taking public transit. 5. Practice situational awareness. Pay attention to your surroundings. Avoid staring at your phone. If using headphones, use only one ear so that you can still hear things that are going on around you. You can also casually look around so that you are aware of the people in your environment. This gives your intuition a chance to sink in and reduces the opportunity for a surprise attack. You can also give people split-second glances: this sends a message of \u201cI see you. If you are up to no good, I am not an easy target.\u201d After losing the element of surprise, an offender will often go elsewhere. 6. Trust your gut. Most importantly, trust your instincts\u2014if something feels off or unsafe, leave the area or seek help. Learn routes where you could possibly run to if needed. Be aware of which businesses are open 24/7, or which buildings have 24/7 security. The Role of Capable Guardians in Women\u2019s Self-Defense Bolstering the presence of effective safeguards or capable guardians is also helping for women\u2019s self-defense as it increases the risks for a potential offender. If you can increase their chances of getting caught, or scare them into thinking that you pose a threat in some way, they may decide to go elsewhere. To enhance capable guardianship when in public spaces, here are some steps that you can take: 1. Stick to well-lit routes. Stick to routes that are well-lit and well-populated when walking and jogging, even if they are slightly longer. When taking public transportation, wait at well-lit stops. Similarly, if you are driving and need to pull over for some reason, look for a well-lit parking lot. 2. Strength in numbers. Travel in groups whenever possible, especially in the late night or early morning. If you take public transportation, try to sit near the driver. When traveling in a group, check in with your friends after parting ways to ensure that everyone got home safely. If you do travel alone, always let someone know your whereabouts and expected return time. 3. Be vigilant when meeting new people. If you are meeting up with someone who you are still getting to know, meet them in a public place the first few times. This also applies when meeting up with people from dating apps or from buying-and-selling apps. For the latter, if you are selling an expensive item, remember that it increases your vulnerability as a potential target. Consider meeting in a public place that is near a police station. Some police departments have designated \u201csafe trade spots\u201d for buying-and-selling apps that are free to use. To find one local to you, check out 4. Make use of technology. Familiarize yourself with emergency apps and phone features that would allow you to quickly call for help if needed. Additionally, there are a range of and wearable smart devices that offer geotagged alerts to , some even equipped with . You can also use non-emergency apps to enable continuous real-time GPS sharing with trusted contacts without the need for individual notifications. 5. Empower Yourself Consider taking women\u2019s self-defense classes to build confidence and learn techniques to in case of an emergency. You can also carry a personal safety device like pepper spray, a personal alarm, a whistle, or even an air horn. Remember, if you are selected as a target but you can put up a fight and draw attention, an offender may decide that you are not worth the risk and go elsewhere. Why Situational Awareness Matters for Women\u2019s Self-Defense After many years of martial arts training, one of the phrases that sticks with me the most is: \u201cthe only fight that you win is the one that you don\u2019t get in.\u201d In terms of women\u2019s self-defense, one of the best ways to avoid violence is through prevention. This is done by being cognizant of your surroundings, being able to identify when something doesn\u2019t look right, and knowing when to take preventive actions. Situational awareness helps you notice things that seem out of the ordinary or suspicious, allowing you to identify potential threats and take preemptive steps to avoid or mitigate potential danger. In our fast-paced world, where distractions abound and our attention is constantly divided, personal safety can sometimes take a backseat. But the truth is, being vigilant and aware of our surroundings is paramount for our safety. Situational awareness extends beyond women\u2019s self-defense and applies to everyday situations, including , ,\u00a0 and online safety, among others. To learn more about the benefits of situational awareness, check out our companion post: \u201c \u201d Empower Yourself Today with Situational Awareness Training You can't always deter a potential offender, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you are powerless. Regardless of the situation you are in, being aware of your surroundings can make all the difference in being able to in your environment, which is a crucial skill in women\u2019s self-defense strategies. Early recognition of potential threats is critical in being able to avoid or mitigate them. Situational awareness is a crucial skill, but it's not just an innate ability. At Second Sight, we understand the importance of staying safe and prepared, which is why we offer the Situational Awareness for Safety course tailored to help individuals, like you, enhance their awareness and make informed choices to protect themselves. I recently took Second Sight\u2019s one-hour online course, , which helped me hone and practice my observational and situational awareness skills. Through this course, I learned how to systematically assess any environment, recognize potential risks, and how to respond accordingly. These skills help me feel safer and more capable of navigating various situations, and I feel empowered that I would actually know how to react if faced with a threat. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to fellow women living in cities, frequent solo travelers, and anyone seeking to enhance their personal safety.

There\u2019s a lot of advice about what to do to protect yourself from attack or assault. Assault is never the fault of the person attacked \u2014 regardless of what they wear, how much they drink or whether they decide to pop in headphones. Nonetheless, for some people, learning the basics of self-defense can increase confidence and help them feel more prepared if they find themselves in a threatening situation. Self-defense is more than knowing how to throw a punch \u2014 and Sergeant Ryan Skiffington, a public safety officer with the University of Washington Medical Center\u2019s Department of Public Safety, believes the best way to stay safe is to stick with disengagement tactics. \u201cSpecific moves get thrown out of the window in real world attacks,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t train a lot on the techniques, chances are you will not execute them properly.\u201d Instead, Skiffington recommends these simple self-defense and disengagement concepts that can help get you out of dangerous situations. Be aware of your surroundings \u201cSituational awareness is the key to all of this,\u201d Skiffington says. Looking around and being aware of what is happening near you can help you notice sudden movement or if something seems out of place. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable in a situation \u2014 say, walking back to your car after a late shift \u2014 it\u2019s best to return to the place you came from and ask someone to walk with you. Skiffington also recommends cutting back on your phone usage while walking. \u201cOne, you could hurt yourself by waking into something or tripping on a curb and falling. Two, someone could attempt to steal you phone right out of your hand,\u201d Skiffington says. Plus, if someone intends to harm you, it will be harder for them to surprise you if you are looking up and are aware of what\u2019s going on around you. De-escalate if possible De-escalation will look different depending on what an attacker wants, but it comes down to doing what you can to safely leave a situation without having to fight. So, if an attacker wants money, give it to them. If someone is picking a fight, don\u2019t engage, even if they are rude or insulting your pride. \u201cThreats should be taken seriously. Do your best to get away from the person and call for help if necessary,\u201d Skiffington says. Maintain distance from your attacker In a situation where you are walking home and think someone is following you, you want to keep distance between the two of you and, if possible, return to the place you came from. There, tell someone what is going on and get help. If you can\u2019t get back to your point of origin, maintain as much distance as possible, then turn and look at the attacker. This might feel like the exact opposite of what you want to do, but Skiffington explains some attackers will back down when they see you are aware of them. In cases where you do have some space, dial 911 to get help or use the panic button on your phone (hold down the side button and one of the volume buttons on an iPhone) to automatically call emergency services. It also helps to keep objects between you and the attacker (think things like cars, tables or anything else nearby). If you end up in a situation where you do need to fight to protect yourself, do your best to avoid getting backed up against a wall. Plan (and prepare for) your escape route Unsafe situations are no time for decorum. Take off high heels, jewelry and any other items that restrain your movement. You want to be able to run to safety if needed. If you\u2019re near your car, Skiffington recommends keeping your keys in your hand for easy access and using the panic button if you have one, which will cause your car to create noise and flash its lights. Keeping your keys handy will help you get into your car faster, and the commotion from your car can draw others to you to help. Train with a weapon before carrying it Lots of people keep pepper spray or brass knuckles on their key chains in case of an attack \u2014 but having a weapon doesn\u2019t mean you will be able to effectively use it. \u201cMost of the time people buy weapons and just leave them in a place they won\u2019t be able to get to in time to use them. Often, weapons are used against the victim because they haven\u2019t trained adequately to use the tool in the first place,\u201d Skiffington says. Whether it\u2019s a firearm, knife, taser or pepper spray, be sure you know how to use a weapon before keeping it on your person. (In other words, if you don\u2019t know how to use that pepper spray keychain, it\u2019s best to not carry it.) Practice disengagement moves Even with the best de-escalation tactics, you might be put in a situation where you have to defend yourself physically. \u201cIn all the fights I have been in over 21 years of hospital security, none of them looked like how I trained,\u201d Skiffington says. \u201cJust focus on the basic principles of the techniques and keep fighting. The will to survive is a powerful weapon all by itself.\u201d Ready for some basic disengagement moves? Let\u2019s get started. Supportive stance In a fight, you want to assume a position with your weight distributed on both feet, a slight bend in your knees and your hands up and ready. Standing at an angle will help you keep your balance if someone hits you, plus\u00a0makes it easier to turn and run. Don't stand straight facing your attacker. Do stand at an angle with your knees bent. UW Medicine Break free from an arm grab If an attacker grabs\u00a0your\u00a0arm, swing\u00a0it\u00a0down toward where their\u00a0thumb and fingers meet (the weakest part of the hold). Yelling or stomping while you rip your arm down can startle the attacker and make it easier to break free. If an attacker grabs your arm, swing it down to break their grip. UW Medicine Break free from someone grabbing your clothes If someone grabs your clothing, you want to grab a handful of your clothing near where their grasp is with one hand and hold their wrist with the other. At the same time, pull your clothing back while you push their wrist away. Grab your clothing and the attacker's wrist. UW Medicine Pull your clothing and push away from the attacker. UW Medicine Break free from a neck grab and arm bar choke hold As much as you can, you want to avoid letting someone close enough to you that they are able to grab your neck. However, if they do, raise your arms above your head so your shoulders squish their hands, loosening their grip, then twist away. First put your hands over your head, then squish the attacker\u2019s hands between your shoulder and neck. UW Medicine Turn out and escape. UW Medicine Arm bar choke holds are hard to get out of, but you do have some options. First, tuck your chin into the crook of the attacker\u2019s elbow while pulling down on their forearm to protect your airway. Pulling down on their arm will also help create some room so the attacker isn\u2019t able to compress the arteries in your neck. To escape the hold, pull on the attacker\u2019s arm and crouch down. Back around the person as much as you can, then push away on the arm against your neck as you tuck your head through the circle of their arms and turn out of the hold. Tuck your chin and pull down on attacker\u2019s arm, then back around the attacker. UW Medicine Slip through the attacker's arms and push away.

SUBMITReset Email sent successfully Try Again ! Self-defence is the ability of a person to protect oneself and one\u2019s dependants from an attack. Even though we are living in relatively peaceful times in the history of mankind, there still are instances where we could face violence unexpectedly. Freezing\u2014or being too shocked to respond\u2014is a common reaction to violence, which results in tragic outcomes for the victim. Impulsive and inappropriate responses can be equally damaging. Prior knowledge of basic self-defence principles provides us a better chance of escaping unhurt. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Just as animals can defend themselves against attacks by predators, the human body has its own natural fighting instincts, which unfortunately have been suppressed due to several reasons. Cultural factors and social pressure to remain peaceful, passive and non-violent prevents us from fighting back when threatened. Besides, we do not have the regular exposure to predators like we once did thousands of years ago\u2014to be able to learn from personal fighting experience. Therefore, actively learning self-defence techniques becomes necessary. Such learning has to be customised to the potential threats we are likely to face in our own microenvironment. For instance, a young woman who lives alone in the city and travels by public transport will be facing a different set of problems compared to a nurse who attends patients in a psychiatry ward, or a shy teenager who is newly admitted to a school notorious for bullying. Self-defence is a life skill that everyone should have in their personal collection. Examples of other life skills include safe road habits, fire safety, ability to correctly perform CPR (for sudden cardiac arrest) and Heimlich manoeuvre (for choking on food), each of which were addressed in my prior articles.

The listed examples represent some of the common problems that we face in society, and their discussions illustrate the fundamental principles of self-defence. A description of basic fight techniques to defend against violence is also included. Those interested in learning more about the physical part of self-defence can seek the help of an instructor. Isn\u2019t it enough to learn Karate? Unfortunately, the term self-defence training is superficially equated by many to martial arts like Karate, Kickboxing, and possession of deadly weapons. This is because people have the impression that if we can fight and overpower our attackers as we see in the movies, we would be safe and all would be well. Learning a martial art such as Karate requires years of training. Martial arts help improve physical fitness, concentration and confidence. However, Karate or Judo skills alone do not ensure safety of an individual. What about a weekend self defence course? Many so-called self-defence courses give undue emphasis on fighting techniques, perhaps because of their dramatic marketing appeal. Although they help boost confidence levels and provide some basic knowledge, the complex manoeuvres taught during these seminars are not easy to recollect when abruptly faced with an attacker later in life. This is due to the process of cortical shut down that occurs in our brain. Fine motor movements are controlled by the brain\u2019s outer layer called cerebral cortex, which fails to work during times of acute stress. The best self-defence is not to get into a fight Real self-defence training goes far beyond learning punching, blocking and kicking. In fact, most accomplished self-defence teachers around the world agree on one thing: the best self-defence is not to get into a fight. It is said that the most powerful self-defence weapon we can hope to have in our arsenal is not muscle power or ability to deliver a flying kick, but a sharp mind. What matters more is our ability to identify and eliminate any high-risk behaviours that we might have, recognize and avoid violence-prone situations around us; and in case we encounter a potential threat of violence, to be able to defuse the situation peacefully and get out of there at the earliest. A sharp mind is our best self-defence tool. Example 1. You are a 35-year-old man employed at Info Park. Driving back from Calicut to Kochi on a Sunday evening, you and a male colleague decide to take a tea break at a small roadside hotel near Thrissur. There are six tables, only two of which are occupied. You sit down at the table by the window. As soon as you place your order for tea and dosa, two local men arrive by bike and enter the restaurant. They come up to your table and ask you to move to the next table, as it was apparently their table that you were sitting on. You try to explain that the table was empty when you came in, and that there was no reservation tag on it. The men are not convinced, and insist that you move. Your friend holds a black belt in Karate, and the men are physically smaller than you. What is the best option? A: Refuse to move as you believe you have the right to that table B: Move to another table C: Get up politely, settle any dues and leave the scene without fuss Answer: C. This is the typical example of a potentially threatening situation that could get worse if we acted without cool-headed thinking. Although theoretically we have every right to remain in our seats and complete our meal, our common sense\u2014our ability to think two steps ahead\u2014 is telling us to leave. We have been unexpectedly caught in an unfamiliar environment, having an unnecessary argument with unknown men. We might think that the men are physically weaker than us, and that we could beat them if a fight broke out. However, we do not know how many accomplices they have, whether they are on drugs, what their criminal background is, and whether one of them is carrying a knife. Being physically smaller does not mean their fighting skills are inferior to ours. It is also possible that we were sitting on the table which these men had been sitting on regularly for years. Besides, in this case, we are not fighting for anything worthwhile, apart from our ego. Our original objective was just to have a tea break; and not to get injured. Although there is a chance that nothing would happen if we continued to sit there, the question is whether it was worth the risk. Most experts would agree that it would be foolish to stay there, as these antisocial elements have obviously picked on us, and will likely continue to taunt us even if we moved to another table. The above example highlights two other principles of self-defence: 1. Do not hang around in the company of stupid people. 2. Do not argue with stupid people. Self-defence is more than just fighting Martial arts champions all around the world have said that if they were threatened with violence by a stranger, their preferred option would be to talk calmly, make peace, avoid fighting and remove themselves from the scene as quickly as possible. Violence, for them, is the last resort, when nothing else would work. Even though they possess the ability to subdue and even kill an opponent with their bare hands, they are aware that in real life, fights are dirty, and the consequences unpredictable. Unlike a martial arts tournament that occurs between matched opponents in a controlled environment where fair fighting laws are enforced, street-fights have no rules. Real life fighting is fast, furious, extremely savage and can break out unexpectedly in unfamiliar zones, frequently against an unknown number of opponents, many of whom could be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. What we initially believe as a single and weak opponent might turn out to be a large gang when his friends join him, sometimes carrying weapons. Even if we are able to subdue our opponent, unfortunately, it is not a case of walking away into the sunset as we see in the movies. Once the police are involved, a case gets registered and both the parties are questioned about the incident. Each person, naturally, would believe that they did the right thing. Even though we believe that we committed the act of violence in self-defence, the court will initially see the case only as an altercation between two citizens with equal rights. It is upon us to prove our case to be one of self-defence, and this is not always easy or successful. The trial can go on for several years, and the more the number of witnesses involved, the longer it takes. If the verdict goes against us, we could be sent to prison. But isn\u2019t self-defence legal? The only certainty about court cases is that things need not go according to our plan. If we plead self-defence, the judge will examine the evidence presented and determine whether the force used was in proportion to the perceived threat. If excessive force was used in response to a seemingly trivial threat, it becomes harder to convince the court that it was a genuine case of self-defence. The principles that the law follows in the context of self-defence are the following: 1. Every individual has the right to defend himself or his dependants. 2. The principle of self-defence is to use a shield, and not a sword. 3. It is impossible for the court to weigh the opposing forces using a golden balance. In other words, even though the principle of using proportionate force is applied, the law allows sufficient space for a person to defend himself in a manner that is reasonable. It is not always practical to match the opponent\u2019s assault force or weapon. The person will have to make do with whatever means of self-defence are immediately available at hand. If the self defence case can be proved with sufficient evidence, the person will be acquitted. Tackling the sexual offender Example 2. You are a 28-year-old woman; you have just boarded a bus from Trissur to Kochi. It is moderately crowded; there is standing room only. You notice a man in his sixties positioning himself uncomfortably close behind you. He seems to be leaning on to you each time the bus braked. You had recently completed a self-defence course and know very well how to hit and injure a person who is harassing you. What is the best option? A: Do nothing, ignore him B. Turn around and glare at him, ask firmly to step back C: Use your self-defence lesson and deliver a slap on to his face or neck Answer: B. A firm and assertive response is warranted here. Doing nothing would encourage this man to continue with this behaviour or worse in the future. As he has not physically laid hands on your body, a reasonable option is B, which will give him a clear signal that you are not a person to be messed around with, and that he could face consequences if he did not back off. It will also alert the other passengers to keep an eye out for this man. Slapping him would be somewhat out of proportion to the perceived offence; and an important principle of self-defence is to balance our response according to the severity of the offence. In other words, if someone attacked you with a knife, and you hit his head with a cricket bat, it could be accepted in court as self-defence. But if someone was whistling at you at the bus stop and you stabbed him with a knife in retaliation, it would not fly as self-defence. The habit of being assertive: a stitch in time saves nine ADVERTISEMENT Speaking up for oneself, being assertive and saying a polite, but firm \u2018no\u2019 at the first sign of unwelcome sexual advance is an effective way to prevent complications including sexual assaults in the long run. Fortunately, in real life, not all such advances are made with an intent to molest or rape. Nevertheless, as a safeguard against future stalking, psychiatrists caution against insulting or humiliating such a person during the rejection process. When faced with such an advance from a person of the opposite sex, silence or apparent lack of objection can get interpreted by a few as consent, sometimes leading on to an unexpected consensual relationship. Such outings can occasionally get complicated when one of the partners wants out, or decides to marry another person. Although some movies seem to convey the impression that rapes are exclusively committed by gangsters and criminals, most real-life sexual assaults in fact occur from within the victim\u2019s domestic, social or professional network. The offender frequently is someone who has respectable social standing, is known to the victim and decided to push his boundary a little too far. Children need to be educated early about protecting themselves from abuse. Both girls as well as boys are vulnerable, and the offender commonly is someone who knows the child as well as the parents. The parents should believe the child when he or she reports such behaviour, and the child must be taught how to say no to bad touch. As children are physically weaker than adults, their main defence is to be able to scream loudly, bite, kick around and run if threatened. The importance of self-control and the danger of being part of a mob During medieval times, the ability to fight was considered one of man\u2019s essential attributes in order to win a woman\u2019s heart. In contemporary civilised society, such concepts are no longer valid. However, movies, TV serials and ads continue to feed on this theme, in the process misleading more than a few men to engage in unnecessary acts of violence. It is no secret that the majority of people serving life sentences in prison for murder are ordinary people with no past criminal background. Unlike premeditated or planned murders, most of these people ended up murdering someone in a sudden rush of blood, only to regret later. Such incidents frequently occur under the influence of alcohol. The lesson from their life stories almost invariably is to have greater self-control and patience while dealing with situations where disagreements can potentially lead to violence. The risk of violence is greater when man is part of a mob, where the individual\u2019s conscience is no longer effective. This is because a mob has a collective mind. Any group greater than three in number is considered a mob, and is capable of committing worse crimes than its individual members. The recent murder of Madhu, a tribal in Wyanad was an example. Veteran criminal lawyers recount tragic stories of ordinary people unwittingly becoming involved in murder cases simply because they were with the wrong crowd in the wrong place at the wrong time. De-escalation: a priceless skill De-escalation is a skill where a person is able to remain calm, and also calm everyone else down in the middle of a heated argument, thus preventing violence from breaking out. An important and underestimated self-defence tool, de-escalation requires communication skills, self-control, good manners and foresight. It has been said that good manners are one of the best self-defence tools one can have. Example 3. Your friend is driving his car, and you are in the passenger seat. The car scratches the side of another car in busy city traffic. No one is injured. Both drivers get out of the cars and start arguing. Your friend feels it is the other person\u2019s mistake, and the other driver says it is all your friend\u2019s fault. The other driver refuses to go to the traffic police station, which is four miles away. A small crowd gathers to watch the action, and both men are really angry now. What is the best option? A: Do nothing, let them continue arguing till one person wins or a fight breaks out B: Talk with your friend, calm him down, offer to pay for the other person\u2019s scratch repair C: Call the police and wait for them to arrive Answer: B: The right thing to do is to immediately deescalate. Some men are overly sensitive about their car\u2019s paint work. Even if a tiny scratch appears, they get upset and lose their temper. They seem to perceive a scratch on their car as the equivalent of a stab wound on their own body. Such irrational behaviour gets copied from other people. In congested city traffic, vehicle body scratches are common, and can occur due to a variety of reasons, not all of which are within our control. Unfortunately, basic human nature is to blame the other person. No driver would bump into another\u2019s vehicle on purpose. A yielding and forgiving mentality needs to be cultivated in road traffic. If immediate de-escalation is not done in such situations, road rage and violence could break out abruptly. A street-fight will ensue with outcomes such as injury, hospitalization, police case and arbitration. Even though the persons involved in the fight did not mean to kill each other, unintended death is known to occur in such situations. This could be, for instance, from a blow to the side of the head or due to a fall on to the hard pavement resulting in serious head injury. A high-profile case that caught public attention involves cricketer-turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, where an argument over a parking space ended up in the death of a 65-year-old man. The trial is still going on after 30 years. Waiting for traffic police to arrive on the scene is an option, but we do not know how long that would take. When the argument is about to fly out of control, it is safer to deescalate immediately and remove ourselves from the scene, even if it means that we have to bear the expense. The immediate settlement offered is minuscule when compared to the alternative, which includes aggravation, time lost, protracted legal proceedings and fees, chance of injury or death, and potential for revenge or retribution. Road rage: a dangerous habit Road rage is a problem all around the world, when people make snap judgments about others based only on a few seconds of observation, and act impulsively. In fact, the average law-abiding citizen in India who leads an otherwise peaceful life is more likely to encounter violence from a stranger on the road than from other situations in his daily routine. Being nice to the next person on the road, accepting that not everyone on the road has the same driving etiquette or expertise, avoiding verbal or gesture exchanges with other road users, readily yielding to aggressive drivers, avoiding needless honking, and not blocking traffic by careless driving are good preventive principles. How do criminals identify whom to target? The most effective way to outwit a criminal is to try and think like one. What is it that prompts them to only pick on certain people? Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan This question has been scientifically studied by several researchers. Greyson and Stein conducted ground-breaking research on criminals who were individually shown videos of random people walking on the street and then asked to pick out whom they would target. The researchers found that all the criminals instinctively picked on the same people from the videos shown to them. Upon a detailed analysis, it was found that those who walked less confidently were perceived as easier targets. The manner of deciding was purely based on body language, specifically the way the person walked. Those people who took short shuffling steps and looked down while walking were picked as targets. Also picked were those who walked with longer and higher strides than others, perhaps because these features indicated nervousness or sense of vulnerability to the watching predator. In contrast, those who walked confidently\u2014that is with an erect posture, eyes looking ahead and with natural swinging of the limbs\u2014were left alone. The reason was simple: the criminals did not want to pick someone who would scream or put up a fight. They were after easy targets. The manner in which human predators identified potential victims was quite similar to how the lion picks a single deer from a large flock of similar-looking deer grazing in the grasslands. The lion watches the flock carefully from a distance, and then spots the deer which is moving slightly slower than its peers, perhaps because of a subtle deformity of its hind limb. The lion does not want to waste his precious energy by chasing a healthy deer that could outrun him. Domestic violence: what no one likes to talk about Although eve teasing, ATM attacks, chain snatching and high-profile rapes get a lot of public attention, domestic violence is the real elephant in the room. Domestic violence appears in various forms and flavours. It is common, and under-reported. Examples can range from an unemployed alcoholic husband beating his wife, to a suspicious wife terrorising her husband by constantly threatening to kill herself for imaginary reasons. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Defending oneself and the rest of the family from domestic violence can be a terrifying experience for the suffering spouse. Fearing escalation or revenge, the abused partner suffers silently like the ostrich that buries its head in sand, hoping in vain that the problem would go away. Just as alcoholism is an addiction requiring treatment by experts, suicidal behaviour is a common manifestation of psychiatric illnesses such as borderline personality disorder and depression. Without treatment, many people who initially make empty threats go on to complete suicide. Unfortunately, society trivialises such psychiatric symptoms, delaying diagnosis and treatment in the process. The spectrum of psychiatric illness in society was outlined in my earlier article. Also read: Regardless of the cited reasons, domestic violence and suicidal threats have no place in a marital relationship. Ignoring or tolerating such behaviour will only make the problem worse. Without correcting the underlying problem, simply learning a few self-defence moves at a weekend course is not the solution here. Informing the local authorities early is the right thing to do. This could involve obtaining the help of social services and law enforcement as the case might be. How to protect oneself if a person is already attacking us? It depends on the type of violence involved. Violence is classified into two forms: spontaneous and premeditated. A road rage incident is a spontaneous incident, where two strangers who started their day as a regular day got into an unexpected argument and a fight broke out. This is quite different from premeditated assault, which is illustrated in the example below. Example 4. You are a 58-year-old man. It is 10 pm and the road is deserted. You are alone and you need to withdraw money from an ATM. As you are coming out of the ATM, a hooded man steps out of the shadows with a knife and politely asks for your money, ATM card and PIN number. You had recently attended a self-defence course and are confident of delivering a good strike. What is the best thing to do? A: Shout for help and start running to your bike parked nearby B: Grab hold of his hand and try to snatch the knife from his hand C: Give him the cash, card and tell him the pin, calmly go home, inform the 24-hour helpline of the bank. D: Surprise him with a kick on his knee, so that he will fall down and you can run away Answer: C. This is an example of premeditated assault. This man has watched you, ascertained that you are a reasonable target and is approaching you with a lethal weapon. You do not know his fighting capability or whether he is on drugs or has killed anyone in the past. From his perspective, he does not want any trouble from you. He is not interested in harming you, and all that he wants is your material possession. In such a situation, the correct thing to do is to do exactly what he says, as the priority is to get away from that situation with minimum damage to your body and life. The money lost can be made up for, but a life lost cannot be. In contrast to premeditated violence in the example above, domestic assault, drunken bar-fights and road rage attacks are typical examples of spontaneous violence. Once preventive strategies and de-escalation techniques fail and violence erupts, we have no option but to physically defend ourselves. ADVERTISEMENT Basic skills to protect ourselves from assault Before discussing specific manoeuvres, it is important to know some universal fighting principles first. Enrolling for a self-defence course is a good way to learn these and get some practice. a. The most vulnerable part on our body is our head. A blow to our head can knock us out, sometimes even kill us. The part of the face below our eyebrow, the chin, the cheek and the temple (the area between the eye and the ear) are most vulnerable. Hence, protecting the head is a matter of priority. b. It is important to have a 360-degree awareness when we are threatened with violence, so that we know what our escape routes are, and whether the attacker has associates lurking around. c. We must maintain our balance, and avoid falling down. Hence the need for practising foot placement and deftly moving around according to the attacker\u2019s position. Standing like a statue with feet close together during a fight is a certain recipe for a fall. d. Our opponent might try to take control of our body by grabbing our wrist, collar, neck or hair. Once he achieves that, he will be able to deliver his punches easily and subdue us. Knowing the specific countermoves ahead of time will help us escape these situations. e. Awareness is helpful at all times; it will help us avoid places of potential trouble. If our intuition or gut feeling is that a particular location is unsafe, it is better to go with it. f. Running away from the scene is still the best form of defence; this is endorsed by all self-defence trainers. It is often said that once a fight breaks out, the loser goes to hospital, and the winner goes to jail. The point here is that there are no real winners in a fight; we are simply setting ourselves up for a series of unpleasant events to follow. For those few who might superficially argue that running away is cowardice, it is worth remembering that we are actually running away from the big three: chance of injury, death and imprisonment. g. The same punch can be delivered with significantly more power after training. Amateurs just use the power of their hands and deliver weak, slow and clumsy punches. In contrast, professionals are able to deliver power from their legs, thighs, body, shoulders as well as their arms and forearms into the fists, generating immense speed and energy as the punch lands on target. This is because they are able to move the whole body as a single unit to deliver the punch, instead of moving just the wrist and elbow. This takes sustained training. h. No matter how big or strong the attacker is, his body has the same weak points that every human being has. These include the eyes, throat, solar plexus (midpoint between the chest and abdomen) and groin. The knees and shin are also vulnerable areas. A strike to any of these areas can stun most assailants. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan i. The palm-heel strike, the ear slap, the elbow strike, the knee-to-groin strike and the head-butt are easy and practical techniques to deliver an effective blow without undergoing much training. The more we practice these, the better we get at it. j. Once we are able to stun or disarm the attacker, our aim must be to get away as quickly as possible. Kicking a fallen assailant or delivering \u2018further physical punishment\u2019 is dangerous, illegal and could land us in prison. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan 1. How to block a punch and protect our head from injury In most spontaneous outbursts of violence initiated by untrained people, a wild swinging punch aimed at our head is the first move from the attacker. Also termed the haymaker punch, experienced fighters do not do this because it is a clumsy move that can easily be blocked and subdued. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan There are many ways of countering this punch, but the easiest method is to move swiftly aside, while maintaining a defensive posture. This involves lowering our chin to protect our face, and raising our arms to eye level with elbows bent and pointing forward, with our palms covering the top of our head. This means that a punch cannot land on that side of our head. Among all our body parts, the back side of our forearm (the hairy side) is the safest to use as a shield against punches or assault weapons. The anatomy of that area makes it less likely to suffer from significant injury, when compared to other parts of the upper limb. 2. How to escape if someone grabs our wrist From among several, the two most effective methods are: \u00bb Take a step towards the attacker and quickly bend your elbow, pointing the elbow at his armpit. This will release the hold no matter how strong he is. Do not to allow him to catch hold of you again. \u00bb Rotate your forearm so that the big bone on the same side of our thumb (radius) is aligned with the gap between his thumb and fingers. An abrupt pull will jerk our hand free from his grip. 3. How to escape if someone grabs our hair Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Among many methods, the easy one to remember is to grasp his grip very firmly (like we would hold a hamburger) with both our hands, and rapidly turn our body around by 180 degrees. This will release his hold and we can run away. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan 4. How to be safe from chain snatching Wearing a gold chain on the neck is an invitation for chain snatchers who typically travel on bikes in pairs. Wearing no jewellery while going outdoors is the best option. Alternatives are to cover the neck with a shawl, or to remove the chain and keep it in our bag while we are walking outdoors. The problem with chain snatching is not just the loss of property, but the risk of head injury or death from falling on the hard ground, or suffering deep wounds in the neck as the chain gets pulled. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan 5. How to tackle an \u2018eve-teaser\u2019 Eve teasers generally prey on the meek and vulnerable. Walking confidently with eyes facing forward, particularly in groups will prompt most eve teasers to look elsewhere. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Animals use camouflage to escape from predators. For example, the praying mantis, certain moths and the chameleon can look exactly like their surroundings. Predator birds therefore fail to notice them. We could use the same idea to escape detection by potential eve teasers. Slipping under the eve teasers\u2019 radar by blending with our surroundings is one way to avoid harassment. For instance, in a particular locality where eve teasing is commonplace, if our aim is to not be picked as a target, wearing dresses that are grossly different from those around us is perhaps not the cleverest thing to do. Keeping the numbers of local law enforcement helplines on fast dial on our mobile phone and promptly reporting eve teasers to the local police is also effective. 6. How to tackle the bus groper These people travel on crowded public buses or trains, and derive pleasure by touching women without consent. Basically, they are cowards looking for easy prey and will not target you if you appear confident and capable of delivering a strike on their cheek if so required. They study the body language of women and mostly target younger people who they think would freeze and will be afraid to speak up. If such a person troubles you, the right thing to do is to give him a firm glare, move away and shout loudly to back off and to not touch you again. This will attract attention from fellow passengers, and will be enough to scare him off. For hands that come prying from far, for instance through gaps in between seats, an effective strategy is to get a firm grip on the offender\u2019s finger and then deliver a sharp prick using a large safety pin. For uninvited sudden hugs from someone sitting by your side on a bench seat, swiftly driving your elbow sideways into his ribs will deliver enough pain to stop him from ever attempting that again on someone else. 7. How to bluff our way to fool a potential attacker In the animal kingdom, bluffing is a common method of escaping from predators. For instance, the milk snake is harmless but has almost the same red stripes as the poisonous coral snake. Potential predators who know about the coral snake will therefore leave the milk snake alone, thinking it is also poisonous. Likewise, we can use sharp thinking to outwit our stalkers. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan While walking alone and there is a chance of eve teasers noticing you, talking on the mobile phone in a loud voice to an imaginary male friend who is about to arrive to pick you up is a clever way to deter any stalker. While boarding a cab or autorickshaw alone at night, it helps to note the number down, and loudly inform an imaginary (or real) friend on the phone about your whereabouts and the vehicle\u2019s registration number. Once the driver hears this, he will know that you are a seasoned and bold traveller, and will leave you alone from any devious plans. Bluffing can also be used to deter thieves from entering your home. Displaying signs such as \u2018beware of dog\u2019, \u2018you are under CCTV surveillance\u2019, placing dummy CCTV cameras and motion-activated floodlights are cheap but popular tricks. The idea is to encourage the thief to look elsewhere. How to create weapons from the environment around us Quick thinking during desperate situations can provide us with surprisingly effective weapons from everyday objects around us. These can used to temporarily stun our attacker so that we can escape. 1. A steel ball point pen, gripped tightly, can be used as a tool to stab an attacker. 2. Car keys and metal hairclips can be used similarly. 3. A whistle is an easy tool to scare off any offenders, considered more effective than screaming. Attackers are generally afraid of noise because it attracts attention. 4. The hard edge of our mobile phone can be used to deliver a painful strike on the neck, ribs, hand or face. 5. A tightly rolled up magazine, torch or umbrella can be used as a club. 6. If we remove our heavy steel watch and put it inside our socks, we can create a powerful weapon by swinging it around. 7. A belt with a heavy steel buckle can used similarly. 8. Using a pepper spray or throwing chilly powder can be helpful if we can do it early enough, but fumbling for it during the time of need makes it an ineffective option. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan 9. Deodorant spray, when pointed at an attacker\u2019s face, can stun him and give us just enough time to run away. 10. A handful of dirt (sand) can be thrown at an attacker\u2019s eyes to temporarily blind him. ADVERTISEMENT In summary, self-defence is a vast subject that includes constant awareness of our own environment, assertiveness, confident body language, knowledge of psychology and law, communication skills, de-escalation ability, diplomacy, common sense, physical fitness, and training in basic blocking and striking techniques. Contrary to the public perception that self-defence is about knowing how to fight, over 90% of it is about being street-smart and having an alert, disciplined, informed and quick-thinking mind.

SUBMIT Reset Email sent successfully Try Again ! Self-defence is the ability of a person to protect oneself and one\u2019s dependants from an attack. Even though we are living in relatively peaceful times in the history of mankind, there still are instances where we could face violence unexpectedly. Freezing\u2014or being too shocked to respond\u2014is a common reaction to violence, which results in tragic outcomes for the victim. Impulsive and inappropriate responses can be equally damaging. Prior knowledge of basic self-defence principles provides us a better chance of escaping unhurt. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Just as animals can defend themselves against attacks by predators, the human body has its own natural fighting instincts, which unfortunately have been suppressed due to several reasons. Cultural factors and social pressure to remain peaceful, passive and non-violent prevents us from fighting back when threatened. Besides, we do not have the regular exposure to predators like we once did thousands of years ago\u2014to be able to learn from personal fighting experience. Therefore, actively learning self-defence techniques becomes necessary. Such learning has to be customised to the potential threats we are likely to face in our own microenvironment. For instance, a young woman who lives alone in the city and travels by public transport will be facing a different set of problems compared to a nurse who attends patients in a psychiatry ward, or a shy teenager who is newly admitted to a school notorious for bullying. Self-defence is a life skill that everyone should have in their personal collection. Examples of other life skills include safe road habits, fire safety, ability to correctly perform CPR (for sudden cardiac arrest) and Heimlich manoeuvre (for choking on food), each of which were addressed in my prior articles.

The listed examples represent some of the common problems that we face in society, and their discussions illustrate the fundamental principles of self-defence. A description of basic fight techniques to defend against violence is also included. Those interested in learning more about the physical part of self-defence can seek the help of an instructor. Isn\u2019t it enough to learn Karate? Unfortunately, the term self-defence training is superficially equated by many to martial arts like Karate, Kickboxing, and possession of deadly weapons. This is because people have the impression that if we can fight and overpower our attackers as we see in the movies, we would be safe and all would be well. Learning a martial art such as Karate requires years of training. Martial arts help improve physical fitness, concentration and confidence. However, Karate or Judo skills alone do not ensure safety of an individual. What about a weekend self defence course? Many so-called self-defence courses give undue emphasis on fighting techniques, perhaps because of their dramatic marketing appeal. Although they help boost confidence levels and provide some basic knowledge, the complex manoeuvres taught during these seminars are not easy to recollect when abruptly faced with an attacker later in life. This is due to the process of cortical shut down that occurs in our brain. Fine motor movements are controlled by the brain\u2019s outer layer called cerebral cortex, which fails to work during times of acute stress. The best self-defence is not to get into a fight Real self-defence training goes far beyond learning punching, blocking and kicking. In fact, most accomplished self-defence teachers around the world agree on one thing: the best self-defence is not to get into a fight. It is said that the most powerful self-defence weapon we can hope to have in our arsenal is not muscle power or ability to deliver a flying kick, but a sharp mind. What matters more is our ability to identify and eliminate any high-risk behaviours that we might have, recognize and avoid violence-prone situations around us; and in case we encounter a potential threat of violence, to be able to defuse the situation peacefully and get out of there at the earliest. A sharp mind is our best self-defence tool. Example 1. You are a 35-year-old man employed at Info Park. Driving back from Calicut to Kochi on a Sunday evening, you and a male colleague decide to take a tea break at a small roadside hotel near Thrissur. There are six tables, only two of which are occupied. You sit down at the table by the window. As soon as you place your order for tea and dosa, two local men arrive by bike and enter the restaurant. They come up to your table and ask you to move to the next table, as it was apparently their table that you were sitting on. You try to explain that the table was empty when you came in, and that there was no reservation tag on it. The men are not convinced, and insist that you move. Your friend holds a black belt in Karate, and the men are physically smaller than you. What is the best option? A: Refuse to move as you believe you have the right to that table B: Move to another table C: Get up politely, settle any dues and leave the scene without fuss Answer: C. This is the typical example of a potentially threatening situation that could get worse if we acted without cool-headed thinking. Although theoretically we have every right to remain in our seats and complete our meal, our common sense\u2014our ability to think two steps ahead\u2014 is telling us to leave. We have been unexpectedly caught in an unfamiliar environment, having an unnecessary argument with unknown men. We might think that the men are physically weaker than us, and that we could beat them if a fight broke out. However, we do not know how many accomplices they have, whether they are on drugs, what their criminal background is, and whether one of them is carrying a knife. Being physically smaller does not mean their fighting skills are inferior to ours. It is also possible that we were sitting on the table which these men had been sitting on regularly for years. Besides, in this case, we are not fighting for anything worthwhile, apart from our ego. Our original objective was just to have a tea break; and not to get injured. Although there is a chance that nothing would happen if we continued to sit there, the question is whether it was worth the risk. Most experts would agree that it would be foolish to stay there, as these antisocial elements have obviously picked on us, and will likely continue to taunt us even if we moved to another table. The above example highlights two other principles of self-defence: 1. Do not hang around in the company of stupid people. 2. Do not argue with stupid people. Self-defence is more than just fighting Martial arts champions all around the world have said that if they were threatened with violence by a stranger, their preferred option would be to talk calmly, make peace, avoid fighting and remove themselves from the scene as quickly as possible. Violence, for them, is the last resort, when nothing else would work. Even though they possess the ability to subdue and even kill an opponent with their bare hands, they are aware that in real life, fights are dirty, and the consequences unpredictable. Unlike a martial arts tournament that occurs between matched opponents in a controlled environment where fair fighting laws are enforced, street-fights have no rules. Real life fighting is fast, furious, extremely savage and can break out unexpectedly in unfamiliar zones, frequently against an unknown number of opponents, many of whom could be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. What we initially believe as a single and weak opponent might turn out to be a large gang when his friends join him, sometimes carrying weapons. Even if we are able to subdue our opponent, unfortunately, it is not a case of walking away into the sunset as we see in the movies. Once the police are involved, a case gets registered and both the parties are questioned about the incident. Each person, naturally, would believe that they did the right thing. Even though we believe that we committed the act of violence in self-defence, the court will initially see the case only as an altercation between two citizens with equal rights. It is upon us to prove our case to be one of self-defence, and this is not always easy or successful. The trial can go on for several years, and the more the number of witnesses involved, the longer it takes. If the verdict goes against us, we could be sent to prison. But isn\u2019t self-defence legal? The only certainty about court cases is that things need not go according to our plan. If we plead self-defence, the judge will examine the evidence presented and determine whether the force used was in proportion to the perceived threat. If excessive force was used in response to a seemingly trivial threat, it becomes harder to convince the court that it was a genuine case of self-defence. The principles that the law follows in the context of self-defence are the following: 1. Every individual has the right to defend himself or his dependants. 2. The principle of self-defence is to use a shield, and not a sword. 3. It is impossible for the court to weigh the opposing forces using a golden balance. In other words, even though the principle of using proportionate force is applied, the law allows sufficient space for a person to defend himself in a manner that is reasonable. It is not always practical to match the opponent\u2019s assault force or weapon. The person will have to make do with whatever means of self-defence are immediately available at hand. If the self defence case can be proved with sufficient evidence, the person will be acquitted. Tackling the sexual offender Example 2. You are a 28-year-old woman; you have just boarded a bus from Trissur to Kochi. It is moderately crowded; there is standing room only. You notice a man in his sixties positioning himself uncomfortably close behind you. He seems to be leaning on to you each time the bus braked. You had recently completed a self-defence course and know very well how to hit and injure a person who is harassing you. What is the best option? A: Do nothing, ignore him B. Turn around and glare at him, ask firmly to step back C: Use your self-defence lesson and deliver a slap on to his face or neck Answer: B. A firm and assertive response is warranted here. Doing nothing would encourage this man to continue with this behaviour or worse in the future. As he has not physically laid hands on your body, a reasonable option is B, which will give him a clear signal that you are not a person to be messed around with, and that he could face consequences if he did not back off. It will also alert the other passengers to keep an eye out for this man. Slapping him would be somewhat out of proportion to the perceived offence; and an important principle of self-defence is to balance our response according to the severity of the offence. In other words, if someone attacked you with a knife, and you hit his head with a cricket bat, it could be accepted in court as self-defence. But if someone was whistling at you at the bus stop and you stabbed him with a knife in retaliation, it would not fly as self-defence. The habit of being assertive: a stitch in time saves nine ADVERTISEMENT Speaking up for oneself, being assertive and saying a polite, but firm \u2018no\u2019 at the first sign of unwelcome sexual advance is an effective way to prevent complications including sexual assaults in the long run. Fortunately, in real life, not all such advances are made with an intent to molest or rape. Nevertheless, as a safeguard against future stalking, psychiatrists caution against insulting or humiliating such a person during the rejection process. When faced with such an advance from a person of the opposite sex, silence or apparent lack of objection can get interpreted by a few as consent, sometimes leading on to an unexpected consensual relationship. Such outings can occasionally get complicated when one of the partners wants out, or decides to marry another person. Although some movies seem to convey the impression that rapes are exclusively committed by gangsters and criminals, most real-life sexual assaults in fact occur from within the victim\u2019s domestic, social or professional network. The offender frequently is someone who has respectable social standing, is known to the victim and decided to push his boundary a little too far. Children need to be educated early about protecting themselves from abuse. Both girls as well as boys are vulnerable, and the offender commonly is someone who knows the child as well as the parents. The parents should believe the child when he or she reports such behaviour, and the child must be taught how to say no to bad touch. As children are physically weaker than adults, their main defence is to be able to scream loudly, bite, kick around and run if threatened. The importance of self-control and the danger of being part of a mob During medieval times, the ability to fight was considered one of man\u2019s essential attributes in order to win a woman\u2019s heart. In contemporary civilised society, such concepts are no longer valid. However, movies, TV serials and ads continue to feed on this theme, in the process misleading more than a few men to engage in unnecessary acts of violence. It is no secret that the majority of people serving life sentences in prison for murder are ordinary people with no past criminal background. Unlike premeditated or planned murders, most of these people ended up murdering someone in a sudden rush of blood, only to regret later. Such incidents frequently occur under the influence of alcohol. The lesson from their life stories almost invariably is to have greater self-control and patience while dealing with situations where disagreements can potentially lead to violence. The risk of violence is greater when man is part of a mob, where the individual\u2019s conscience is no longer effective. This is because a mob has a collective mind. Any group greater than three in number is considered a mob, and is capable of committing worse crimes than its individual members. The recent murder of Madhu, a tribal in Wyanad was an example. Veteran criminal lawyers recount tragic stories of ordinary people unwittingly becoming involved in murder cases simply because they were with the wrong crowd in the wrong place at the wrong time. De-escalation: a priceless skill De-escalation is a skill where a person is able to remain calm, and also calm everyone else down in the middle of a heated argument, thus preventing violence from breaking out. An important and underestimated self-defence tool, de-escalation requires communication skills, self-control, good manners and foresight. It has been said that good manners are one of the best self-defence tools one can have. Example 3. Your friend is driving his car, and you are in the passenger seat. The car scratches the side of another car in busy city traffic. No one is injured. Both drivers get out of the cars and start arguing. Your friend feels it is the other person\u2019s mistake, and the other driver says it is all your friend\u2019s fault. The other driver refuses to go to the traffic police station, which is four miles away. A small crowd gathers to watch the action, and both men are really angry now. What is the best option? A: Do nothing, let them continue arguing till one person wins or a fight breaks out B: Talk with your friend, calm him down, offer to pay for the other person\u2019s scratch repair C: Call the police and wait for them to arrive Answer: B: The right thing to do is to immediately deescalate. Some men are overly sensitive about their car\u2019s paint work. Even if a tiny scratch appears, they get upset and lose their temper. They seem to perceive a scratch on their car as the equivalent of a stab wound on their own body. Such irrational behaviour gets copied from other people. In congested city traffic, vehicle body scratches are common, and can occur due to a variety of reasons, not all of which are within our control. Unfortunately, basic human nature is to blame the other person. No driver would bump into another\u2019s vehicle on purpose. A yielding and forgiving mentality needs to be cultivated in road traffic. If immediate de-escalation is not done in such situations, road rage and violence could break out abruptly. A street-fight will ensue with outcomes such as injury, hospitalization, police case and arbitration. Even though the persons involved in the fight did not mean to kill each other, unintended death is known to occur in such situations. This could be, for instance, from a blow to the side of the head or due to a fall on to the hard pavement resulting in serious head injury. A high-profile case that caught public attention involves cricketer-turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, where an argument over a parking space ended up in the death of a 65-year-old man. The trial is still going on after 30 years. Waiting for traffic police to arrive on the scene is an option, but we do not know how long that would take. When the argument is about to fly out of control, it is safer to deescalate immediately and remove ourselves from the scene, even if it means that we have to bear the expense. The immediate settlement offered is minuscule when compared to the alternative, which includes aggravation, time lost, protracted legal proceedings and fees, chance of injury or death, and potential for revenge or retribution. Road rage: a dangerous habit Road rage is a problem all around the world, when people make snap judgments about others based only on a few seconds of observation, and act impulsively. In fact, the average law-abiding citizen in India who leads an otherwise peaceful life is more likely to encounter violence from a stranger on the road than from other situations in his daily routine. Being nice to the next person on the road, accepting that not everyone on the road has the same driving etiquette or expertise, avoiding verbal or gesture exchanges with other road users, readily yielding to aggressive drivers, avoiding needless honking, and not blocking traffic by careless driving are good preventive principles. How do criminals identify whom to target? The most effective way to outwit a criminal is to try and think like one. What is it that prompts them to only pick on certain people? Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan This question has been scientifically studied by several researchers. Greyson and Stein conducted ground-breaking research on criminals who were individually shown videos of random people walking on the street and then asked to pick out whom they would target. The researchers found that all the criminals instinctively picked on the same people from the videos shown to them. Upon a detailed analysis, it was found that those who walked less confidently were perceived as easier targets. The manner of deciding was purely based on body language, specifically the way the person walked. Those people who took short shuffling steps and looked down while walking were picked as targets. Also picked were those who walked with longer and higher strides than others, perhaps because these features indicated nervousness or sense of vulnerability to the watching predator. In contrast, those who walked confidently\u2014that is with an erect posture, eyes looking ahead and with natural swinging of the limbs\u2014were left alone. The reason was simple: the criminals did not want to pick someone who would scream or put up a fight. They were after easy targets. The manner in which human predators identified potential victims was quite similar to how the lion picks a single deer from a large flock of similar-looking deer grazing in the grasslands. The lion watches the flock carefully from a distance, and then spots the deer which is moving slightly slower than its peers, perhaps because of a subtle deformity of its hind limb. The lion does not want to waste his precious energy by chasing a healthy deer that could outrun him. Domestic violence: what no one likes to talk about Although eve teasing, ATM attacks, chain snatching and high-profile rapes get a lot of public attention, domestic violence is the real elephant in the room. Domestic violence appears in various forms and flavours. It is common, and under-reported. Examples can range from an unemployed alcoholic husband beating his wife, to a suspicious wife terrorising her husband by constantly threatening to kill herself for imaginary reasons. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Defending oneself and the rest of the family from domestic violence can be a terrifying experience for the suffering spouse. Fearing escalation or revenge, the abused partner suffers silently like the ostrich that buries its head in sand, hoping in vain that the problem would go away. Just as alcoholism is an addiction requiring treatment by experts, suicidal behaviour is a common manifestation of psychiatric illnesses such as borderline personality disorder and depression. Without treatment, many people who initially make empty threats go on to complete suicide. Unfortunately, society trivialises such psychiatric symptoms, delaying diagnosis and treatment in the process. The spectrum of psychiatric illness in society was outlined in my earlier article. Also read: Regardless of the cited reasons, domestic violence and suicidal threats have no place in a marital relationship. Ignoring or tolerating such behaviour will only make the problem worse. Without correcting the underlying problem, simply learning a few self-defence moves at a weekend course is not the solution here. Informing the local authorities early is the right thing to do. This could involve obtaining the help of social services and law enforcement as the case might be. How to protect oneself if a person is already attacking us? It depends on the type of violence involved. Violence is classified into two forms: spontaneous and premeditated. A road rage incident is a spontaneous incident, where two strangers who started their day as a regular day got into an unexpected argument and a fight broke out. This is quite different from premeditated assault, which is illustrated in the example below. Example 4. You are a 58-year-old man. It is 10 pm and the road is deserted. You are alone and you need to withdraw money from an ATM. As you are coming out of the ATM, a hooded man steps out of the shadows with a knife and politely asks for your money, ATM card and PIN number. You had recently attended a self-defence course and are confident of delivering a good strike. What is the best thing to do? A: Shout for help and start running to your bike parked nearby B: Grab hold of his hand and try to snatch the knife from his hand C: Give him the cash, card and tell him the pin, calmly go home, inform the 24-hour helpline of the bank. D: Surprise him with a kick on his knee, so that he will fall down and you can run away Answer: C. This is an example of premeditated assault. This man has watched you, ascertained that you are a reasonable target and is approaching you with a lethal weapon. You do not know his fighting capability or whether he is on drugs or has killed anyone in the past. From his perspective, he does not want any trouble from you. He is not interested in harming you, and all that he wants is your material possession. In such a situation, the correct thing to do is to do exactly what he says, as the priority is to get away from that situation with minimum damage to your body and life. The money lost can be made up for, but a life lost cannot be. In contrast to premeditated violence in the example above, domestic assault, drunken bar-fights and road rage attacks are typical examples of spontaneous violence. Once preventive strategies and de-escalation techniques fail and violence erupts, we have no option but to physically defend ourselves. ADVERTISEMENT Basic skills to protect ourselves from assault Before discussing specific manoeuvres, it is important to know some universal fighting principles first. Enrolling for a self-defence course is a good way to learn these and get some practice. a. The most vulnerable part on our body is our head. A blow to our head can knock us out, sometimes even kill us. The part of the face below our eyebrow, the chin, the cheek and the temple (the area between the eye and the ear) are most vulnerable. Hence, protecting the head is a matter of priority. b. It is important to have a 360-degree awareness when we are threatened with violence, so that we know what our escape routes are, and whether the attacker has associates lurking around. c. We must maintain our balance, and avoid falling down. Hence the need for practising foot placement and deftly moving around according to the attacker\u2019s position. Standing like a statue with feet close together during a fight is a certain recipe for a fall. d. Our opponent might try to take control of our body by grabbing our wrist, collar, neck or hair. Once he achieves that, he will be able to deliver his punches easily and subdue us. Knowing the specific countermoves ahead of time will help us escape these situations. e. Awareness is helpful at all times; it will help us avoid places of potential trouble. If our intuition or gut feeling is that a particular location is unsafe, it is better to go with it. f. Running away from the scene is still the best form of defence; this is endorsed by all self-defence trainers. It is often said that once a fight breaks out, the loser goes to hospital, and the winner goes to jail. The point here is that there are no real winners in a fight; we are simply setting ourselves up for a series of unpleasant events to follow. For those few who might superficially argue that running away is cowardice, it is worth remembering that we are actually running away from the big three: chance of injury, death and imprisonment. g. The same punch can be delivered with significantly more power after training. Amateurs just use the power of their hands and deliver weak, slow and clumsy punches. In contrast, professionals are able to deliver power from their legs, thighs, body, shoulders as well as their arms and forearms into the fists, generating immense speed and energy as the punch lands on target. This is because they are able to move the whole body as a single unit to deliver the punch, instead of moving just the wrist and elbow. This takes sustained training. h. No matter how big or strong the attacker is, his body has the same weak points that every human being has. These include the eyes, throat, solar plexus (midpoint between the chest and abdomen) and groin. The knees and shin are also vulnerable areas. A strike to any of these areas can stun most assailants. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan i. The palm-heel strike, the ear slap, the elbow strike, the knee-to-groin strike and the head-butt are easy and practical techniques to deliver an effective blow without undergoing much training. The more we practice these, the better we get at it. j. Once we are able to stun or disarm the attacker, our aim must be to get away as quickly as possible. Kicking a fallen assailant or delivering \u2018further physical punishment\u2019 is dangerous, illegal and could land us in prison. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan 1. How to block a punch and protect our head from injury In most spontaneous outbursts of violence initiated by untrained people, a wild swinging punch aimed at our head is the first move from the attacker. Also termed the haymaker punch, experienced fighters do not do this because it is a clumsy move that can easily be blocked and subdued. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan There are many ways of countering this punch, but the easiest method is to move swiftly aside, while maintaining a defensive posture. This involves lowering our chin to protect our face, and raising our arms to eye level with elbows bent and pointing forward, with our palms covering the top of our head. This means that a punch cannot land on that side of our head. Among all our body parts, the back side of our forearm (the hairy side) is the safest to use as a shield against punches or assault weapons. The anatomy of that area makes it less likely to suffer from significant injury, when compared to other parts of the upper limb. 2. How to escape if someone grabs our wrist From among several, the two most effective methods are: \u00bb Take a step towards the attacker and quickly bend your elbow, pointing the elbow at his armpit. This will release the hold no matter how strong he is. Do not to allow him to catch hold of you again. \u00bb Rotate your forearm so that the big bone on the same side of our thumb (radius) is aligned with the gap between his thumb and fingers. An abrupt pull will jerk our hand free from his grip. 3. How to escape if someone grabs our hair Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Among many methods, the easy one to remember is to grasp his grip very firmly (like we would hold a hamburger) with both our hands, and rapidly turn our body around by 180 degrees. This will release his hold and we can run away. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan 4. How to be safe from chain snatching Wearing a gold chain on the neck is an invitation for chain snatchers who typically travel on bikes in pairs. Wearing no jewellery while going outdoors is the best option. Alternatives are to cover the neck with a shawl, or to remove the chain and keep it in our bag while we are walking outdoors. The problem with chain snatching is not just the loss of property, but the risk of head injury or death from falling on the hard ground, or suffering deep wounds in the neck as the chain gets pulled. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan 5. How to tackle an \u2018eve-teaser\u2019 Eve teasers generally prey on the meek and vulnerable. Walking confidently with eyes facing forward, particularly in groups will prompt most eve teasers to look elsewhere. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan Animals use camouflage to escape from predators. For example, the praying mantis, certain moths and the chameleon can look exactly like their surroundings. Predator birds therefore fail to notice them. We could use the same idea to escape detection by potential eve teasers. Slipping under the eve teasers\u2019 radar by blending with our surroundings is one way to avoid harassment. For instance, in a particular locality where eve teasing is commonplace, if our aim is to not be picked as a target, wearing dresses that are grossly different from those around us is perhaps not the cleverest thing to do. Keeping the numbers of local law enforcement helplines on fast dial on our mobile phone and promptly reporting eve teasers to the local police is also effective. 6. How to tackle the bus groper These people travel on crowded public buses or trains, and derive pleasure by touching women without consent. Basically, they are cowards looking for easy prey and will not target you if you appear confident and capable of delivering a strike on their cheek if so required. They study the body language of women and mostly target younger people who they think would freeze and will be afraid to speak up. If such a person troubles you, the right thing to do is to give him a firm glare, move away and shout loudly to back off and to not touch you again. This will attract attention from fellow passengers, and will be enough to scare him off. For hands that come prying from far, for instance through gaps in between seats, an effective strategy is to get a firm grip on the offender\u2019s finger and then deliver a sharp prick using a large safety pin. For uninvited sudden hugs from someone sitting by your side on a bench seat, swiftly driving your elbow sideways into his ribs will deliver enough pain to stop him from ever attempting that again on someone else. 7. How to bluff our way to fool a potential attacker In the animal kingdom, bluffing is a common method of escaping from predators. For instance, the milk snake is harmless but has almost the same red stripes as the poisonous coral snake. Potential predators who know about the coral snake will therefore leave the milk snake alone, thinking it is also poisonous. Likewise, we can use sharp thinking to outwit our stalkers. Graphics sourced by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan While walking alone and there is a chance of eve teasers noticing you, talking on the mobile phone in a loud voice to an imaginary male friend who is about to arrive to pick you up is a clever way to deter any stalker. While boarding a cab or autorickshaw alone at night, it helps to note the number down, and loudly inform an imaginary (or real) friend on the phone about your whereabouts and the vehicle\u2019s registration number. Once the driver hears this, he will know that you are a seasoned and bold traveller, and will leave you alone from any devious plans. Bluffing can also be used to deter thieves from entering your home. Displaying signs such as \u2018beware of dog\u2019, \u2018you are under CCTV surveillance\u2019, placing dummy CCTV cameras and motion-activated floodlights are cheap but popular tricks. The idea is to encourage the thief to look elsewhere. How to create weapons from the environment around us Quick thinking during desperate situations can provide us with surprisingly effective weapons from everyday objects around us. These can used to temporarily stun our attacker so that we can escape. 1. A steel ball point pen, gripped tightly, can be used as a tool to stab an attacker. 2. Car keys and metal hairclips can be used similarly. 3. A whistle is an easy tool to scare off any offenders, considered more effective than screaming. Attackers are generally afraid of noise because it attracts attention. 4. The hard edge of our mobile phone can be used to deliver a painful strike on the neck, ribs, hand or face. 5. A tightly rolled up magazine, torch or umbrella can be used as a club. 6. If we remove our heavy steel watch and put it inside our socks, we can create a powerful weapon by swinging it around. 7. A belt with a heavy steel buckle can used similarly. 8. Using a pepper spray or throwing chilly powder can be helpful if we can do it early enough, but fumbling for it during the time of need makes it an ineffective option.

A handful of dirt (sand) can be thrown at an attacker\u2019s eyes to temporarily blind him. ADVERTISEMENT In summary, self-defence is a vast subject that includes constant awareness of our own environment, assertiveness, confident body language, knowledge of psychology and law, communication skills, de-escalation ability, diplomacy, common sense, physical fitness, and training in basic blocking and striking techniques. Contrary to the public perception that self-defence is about knowing how to fight, over 90% of it is about being street-smart and having an alert, disciplined, informed and quick-thinking mind.

By Gemma Sheehan, Founder of You might not prevail against a pro MMA fighter in the octagon; but everyone has the power to survive or avoid the most common attacks that occur in the real world. This power comes not from being stronger but by understanding strategy. Strategy is what allows you to succeed without fighting- and what gives you the advantage when fighting is necessary. Here are ten of those strategies. \"One need not destroy his enemy, one need only destroy his willingness to engage\" - Sun Tzu Strategy - Awareness of Surroundings and the People In Them Awareness is as simple as it is powerful. It deters criminals, lets you detect threats ahead of time and gives your intuition the information it needs to protect you. An alert person is more difficult to attack than a distracted person and therefore less likely to be selected for crime. \u2014 was able to avert a kidnapping because her awareness allowed her to see danger ahead of time. Predators aim to catch victims off guard so that by the time they realize what's happening it's too late. Your eyes, ears, and intuition have been perfected over centuries for the sole purpose of keeping you alive. They are highly effective survival tools- never allow them to be shut down in public. Strategy - Trust Your Instincts Many women who were attacked say they had a bad feeling beforehand but ignored it. In order to not appear rude or paranoid we so often interrogate and deny our own survival instincts. But that gut feeling that something isn't right is the most important warning sign that you are not safe. Instincts work faster than intellect when it comes to your safety and require no further validation. Always listen to your gut feeling about a person, place or situation. \"Your instincts get two things right: they are always based on something, and they always have your best interest at heart\" - Gavin De Becker \u2014This is a about a woman who was on a date with Ted Bundy. She got such a bad feeling about him that she called her brother to pick her up mid-date. It doesn't matter if your gut instinct is wrong, what matters is that it could be right. Tip - Present Yourself Confidently Body language is one of the most important indicators of a persons willingness to fight back. show that predators judge vulnerability by observing how people walk. Someone who walks confidently with their shoulders back and head up and moves swiftly with purpose is perceived to be likely and capable of standing up for themselves. Someone who hangs their head, avoids eye contact, and walks with a sense of defeatedness is perceived to be unlikely to put up a fight. Confident body language is what tells a predator within a seconds glance that you are not an easy target. When you move, move with confidence. \"Given the same amount of intelligence, timidity will do a thousand times more damage than audacity\" -Carl Von Clausewitz (On War) Strategy - Deny Attack Opportunities Attackers don't look for fights, they look for opportunities. Finding attack opportunities involve considerations like: finding a place and time where no one is around to intervene positioning themselves to surprise you or attacking when you're distracted using lures to bait victims into approaching willingly attacking when the victim has no capacity to defend themselves (intoxicated) Criminals spend their lives honing these tactics while the average person spends little time considering their vulnerability to them. Like a master checkmates a novice, the criminal is usually ten steps ahead of the victim when setting their trap. Our defensive strategy needs to include actively denying openings for attack. Other people are your greatest protection. Stick with friends and take paths with people around. Observe those around you- if someone seems to be following you, paying too much attention to you, or is in a position where they could surprise or trap you, stay away from them. If someone on an elevator gives you the creeps, wait for the next one. If someone is lingering by your car or front door, wait for them to leave. You cannot defend what you cannot see which is why most attacks come from behind. Consider what's behind you. When waiting for a bus stand with your back against a wall so you can see all angles. Positioning yourself so that you cannot be surprised or cornered makes it difficult for a predator to find an attack opportunity. \"Don't rely on the enemy not attacking, but on your position that cannot be attacked\" -Sun Tzu Strategy - Recognize Lures Lures are used to lower your guard and give the attacker an excuse to get close enough to attack. They are much more common than physical force attacks. For example: Ted Bundy used the 'help me' trick by asking women for help putting things in his trunk. The help me trick can look like asking for directions, looking for a lost pet, asking to use your phone, etc. Unsolicited offers for help are also very common. Offers to help with groceries, give you a ride, help you with your car that broke down, etc. Child predators entice children to approach their car by offering free stuff, showing animals, asking for help, or by simply starting a conversation. Home invaders bait victims to open the door by pretending to be a salesman or neighbour. Fake emergencies are a guise used by criminals like abductors and home invaders. Lures lower the criminals risk by reducing the amount of time an attack will take and eliminating escape options. They work so well because they exploit our virtues: our desire to help others, to reciprocate, to be nice and not offend. Recognize lures for what they are- an excuse to be allowed into your personal space. The street is the most common site of abduction, and lures are the most common strategy. Therefore as a rule , you should never get close to someone's car when the driver starts a conversation with you, regardless of what comes out of their mouth. Strategy - Say No and Mean It Predators use conversation to 'interview' you to see if you will be an easy target. When someone speaks to you, speak with confidence and firmness. Don't shy away from eye contact. Say no to anything that you do not want to do or to anything that would put you in danger like getting close to someones car or going in their house. No is a complete sentence requiring no explanation or negotiation. The ability to say no and mean it is as fundamental as self defense gets; it says 'your will will not be imposed on me.' Also, someone who refuses to accept no as an answer is showing you that they are trying to control you, and that's a very important danger signal. \"If you let someone talk you out of the word no, you might as well wear a sign on your chest that says \"you are in charge\" -Gavin De Becker Strategy - Protect Your Personal Space Understanding distance is a key skill in martial arts and self defense. If someone wants to hurt you they must first get close to you. The closer they get they fewer options you have. Aim to keep people at a two arms length distance away. That's your personal space. Anyone within that space is a potential threat. If someone speaks to you in public respond from your safe distance. If they inch closer to you maintain distance by moving away. If the attacker is far enough from you that they can't reach out and grab you from behind, run. If you can't run away without being grabbed, keep as much distance from the attacker as you can but face them head on so you are ready to defend yourself. Distance is your first defense Strategy - Be The Threat If an attacker chooses you he has made the calculation that he can get away with the attack. This is where you prove him wrong and show him that you are the threat to him\u2014 not the other way around. Once a physical attack is predicted delay it as long as you can by running, keeping your distance, or forcing them around physical obstacles. Their window of opportunity is small and vanishes with each passing second. Draw attention to the attack by yelling things that alert others and frighten the attacker: \"HELP\", \"GET AWAY FROM ME\", \"RAPIST\", \"POLICE\"; as loud as you can. If you can't run away, face them head on and put your hands up to a 'stop position' at temple height (or a fighting stance). If they attack you fight back with as much aggression as you can. Your goal isn't to win the fight but to create an opening for escape. When you have enough space to turn your back, run. The last thing that an attacker expects is a vicious counter-attack. Never forget how much of a threat you are to the attacker and show them that from the first moment. \" \" - Jeff Cooper Strategy - Use Simple Weapons Even experienced fighters are wise to stick to the most simple and effective tools available in a real life situation. Use the hard, pointy parts of your body to strike soft parts of your attacker. Some safe, easy to learn strikes: With the point of your elbow, elbow the face (chin, temple, back of the head). Turn your body with the elbow to increase power. Knee the groin, stomach, or head. Using your back leg, bend your knee to make it as pointy as you can and drive it forward with all your power. escaped her attacker by kneeing him as hard as she could. Eye poke: using your rear hand, drive your first two fingers aggressively towards the attackers eyes. Just the threat of this is enough to make an attacker move back and give you space. These are all close range strikes, meaning they can be used when someone is grabbing or choking you. Also, a groin strike usually opens the opportunity for an elbow to the face and vice versa. This strategy is called 'high-low'. If you strike, do so aggressively and without hesitation the first time. Force them to respect your attack and shift into defense mode. As soon as they give you an opening to escape, take it. Strategy - Never Go to a Second Location The secondary location is the place that an abductor is trying to take the victim. It's usually a private place that allows them to commit their desired crime without risk. As soon as the victim is taken to the secondary location the chance of survival plummets to almost zero. You must do everything you can to defend yourself where the attack first happens. This is where you have the most advantage over the attacker and where the attacker has the greatest chance of getting caught or giving up. The attacker may threaten to hurt you if you don't comply, or promise not to hurt you if you do. This is only to remove the possibility of successful resistance. If an attacker is willing to hurt you in public with risk, imagine what he is capable of doing in a risk-free isolated location. In self defense, options equal survival. Never let an attacker remove your options. Don't allow your hands to be tied. Don't allow yourself to be put into the car or taken to a second location. You must fight back while you have the option to and while your chances of success are still high. I hope you learned something new about how to protect yourself and your loved ones today! I'd like to finish with a powerful quote by Sun Tzu: \"you don't need to destroy your enemy \u2014 you only need to destroy their willingness to engage.\" This is my all time favorite quote on self defense because it's true, accomplishable, and leads to the best outcome of never having to fight. Think about how you can destroy an attackers willingness to target you on your every day routes.

The difference between walking away and becoming tomorrow's newspaper headline is how well you are prepared to protect yourself in a bad situation. You can prepare some simple techniques to defend yourself before and during an attack, whether it be a fight or an ambush, ensuring your safety. Steps Part 1 Part 1 of 4: Maintaining a Defensive Posture 1 Guard your face. If the attacker is trying to punch you or grab you from the front, put your hands on your forehead in a \"Not in the face!\" sort of gesture and hold your arms tight on your body. XResearch source This may look like a weak defensive position, but that is to your advantage since it brings your opponent's guard down. In addition, this position protects your face and your ribs, two places you'll likely want to protect. 2 Stand with a wide base. Both left-to-right and back-to-front, keep your feet diagonal from each other in a kind of martial-arts stance. This will lessen your likelihood of getting knocked or pushed over. XResearch source You stand the best chance of winning a fight and getting away if you stay upright. Avoid taking the scuffle to the ground at all costs. Advertisement 3 Assess your assailant. Look at their hands. If they were about to attack with their hands, they would have their hands out. However, if they are concealing a weapon, they will have them hidden or at their side. If you're attacked by a person with a knife or a gun, you need to try to avoid confrontation and get away. If it's impossible to avoid a fight, you need to end the confrontation with a high-impact attack as quickly as possible, then run for help. 4 Take the defensive posture of running. Unless your attacker is making it impossible, trying to get away is the only guarantee of your safety. If you can avoid a fight, avoid it and run away. Remember to never turn your back on an opponent. If you do this the opponent will use this as a chance to attack. Advertisement Part 2 Part 2 of 4: Defending Yourself from the Front 1 Go for the eyes and nose. If you have to end the fight as quickly as possible by striking first, strike hard, and strike as many times as you can, then run for help. Getting ambushed in an alley by a mugger isn't the time to worry about fighting honorably. Keep yourself safe by making the confrontation as quickly as possible. XResearch source. The eyes and nose are the most sensitive soft spots on your attacker's face and are vulnerable to elbows, knees, and your forehead With the hardest part of your forehead, right near the hairline, try to smash your assailant's nose by tensing your neck and driving your forehead into the middle of their face. This is the quickest and most unexpected way to end a fight completely. However strong, experienced, or violent your attacker, it's very difficult to quickly recover from a hard head-butt to the nose. 2 Kick or grab the groin of an attacker. Bringing a knee sharply into the groin of an attacker or grabbing the groin with your hand and twisting is an instantly effective move that will take your attacker down. Again, this isn't the time to worry about fighting dirty. If your life is in danger, go for the groin. XResearch source If this doubles up your opponent, consider smashing your knee into their nose to ensure that they'll be down for the count. 3 Stomp your heel. If your being attacked from the back, chances are the attacker has their arms around your upper half. If your wearing heels or shoes such as heavy heel boots, this is especially effective. Move your foot near the attacker's, lift your foot up and bring it down on their foot as hard as you can. If they let you go, run; if they don't, try the next idea. 4 Go for the kneecaps. If, for example, you are being choked, or your assailant has their hands up in your face, attacking their legs will give you the opportunity to open them up to more attacks, or allow you to escape. This is especially effective on larger attackers and easy to do from your guarded position. Kick at shins and knees soccer-style, with the instep of your foot. This is a quick and painful kick. In addition, if their legs are close enough, lift your knees into their inner leg (femoral nerve), outer leg, knee, or groin. These will break down your attacker and may disable them. 5 Follow up. Try to poke or press on the eyes. No one can defend an eye poke, regardless of your attacker's size. Clapping on the ears can stun or, if done perfectly, breaks the eardrums. In some cases you may also want to attack your attacker's neck. To effectively choke someone, do not do the typical Hollywood \"hands around the entire neck,\" but instead just put your thumb and fingers around the trachea (especially easy to find on men with large Adam's apples). Dig, drive, and sink your fingers into this notch and they will experience intense pain and probably fall down. Note that poking the eyes, breaking the eardrums, and choking someone can all be extremely harmful. Only do these actions in extreme circumstances in which your life may be in danger otherwise. 6 Fall onto your attacker if you lose your balance. If you fall, try to fall on top of your attacker. You'll want to avoid taking the fight to the ground at all costs, but if it's unavoidable, use your weight to your advantage. While falling, keep the pointy parts of your body pointy (your knees and your elbows) and aim for your attacker's groin, ribs, and neck. 7 Be prepared for an assault with a weapon. If an attacker attacks with a weapon, know where the weapon is effective. If your attacker has a knife, try to stay out of arm's length. If there is a gun, consider running and dodging from left to right. If you get a chance to leave safely, go for it. Be sure that you're safe from your opponent when you decide to stop defending yourself. In many cases, you can end the situation immediately by giving the attacker your wallet. This is a logical choice, especially if at knife or gunpoint. Your life is worth much more than the cash and cards you have on you. Toss the wallet away from you and run. Advertisement Part 3 Part 3 of 4: Defending Your Back 1 Deflect the hold. If an attacker tries to grab you from behind to choke you, press their forearm against your collarbone instead of trying to pull it directly off, which may be difficult if you're fighting with someone stronger than you. Put one hand above their elbow (on the forearm) and one hand below it (so your hands are on both sides of the elbow). Now, in one strong and determined movement, step and swing your entire body around like the arm is the hinge to your body's screen door. XResearch source This will get you out of their choke and leave their head, ribs, and legs wide open to your counterattack. When your attacker is behind you, the shins are right behind your legs and primed for your stomping and raking. 2 Sit down. If the attacker is trying to pick you up from behind, drop your hips quickly and violently, as if you were plopping down on a love seat. This will make you harder to pick up and give you an extra moment to attack them and fend them off by stomping on their shins or repositioning for a frontal defense. 3 Get dirty. If the attacker is trying to choke you by wrapping his arms around your neck, bring the ball of your foot forward, as if you just kicked a soccer ball, and forcefully slam it into the area of their leg between their ankle and mid-leg, or the groin. This may break their leg or otherwise incapacitate your attacker. Advertisement Part 4 Part 4 of 4: Avoiding Confrontation 1 Understand the stages of a fight. Preparing for each stage in a confrontation can help you avoid eventually ending up in a physical fight. Avoiding a serious fight should be your main goal, so you need to be bigger and more aware of the situation than your opponent. The stages of conflict include: The wind up. This is the initial argument before the fight erupts. It might start out relatively harmless but escalate quickly and unexpectedly. Verbal threats. When the arguing brings in the threat of physical confrontation, try saying \"I'm going to _____\". Shoving or other prodding behavior. Attempts to get you to escalate a conflict into a full-blown fight usually start not with punches or kicks but with nose-to-nose intimidation tactics and shoves. It's still possible to walk away at this point without getting into a full-blown fight. The full-blown fight. You've stopped arguing and started throwing punches. XResearch source 2 Take all verbal or directional paths to non-confrontation. Each of the lead-up steps above are opportunities to end the argument. One will inevitably lead to another unless one of you backs down, so try to back down. Actual physical confrontation should be your last line of defense. XResearch source If you're in the middle of an argument, calm it down by lowering your voice. Macho dudes in a bar can escalate stupid things quickly but be ready to hug and buy you a drink by apologizing and distracting them. If you're calm, they'll cool down. If you're being ambushed by an attacker, you need to get where people can see you and help you. It's less likely that you'll be grievously harmed if you're on a busy street corner where people are passing by. The confrontation has less of a chance of escalating in public. 3 Avoid walking alone. If you've got a long walk home from the bus or train station at night after work, consider meeting a friend near the metro stop and walking together. Staying in groups is the safest way to avoid these kinds of situations. If you must walk alone, gloom onto another group of walkers and stick close by. You don't have to know them to find safety in numbers. 4 Arm yourself. Concealed handguns, mace, or pepper spray are all handy defense devices you should consider having at the ready. Knives and guns are dangerous weapons many consider useful, but can also be used against you if you're unprepared to use them yourself. Be very cautious and smart if you choose to carry a weapon and take the proper certification classes to make sure you know how to handle a weapon safely. Never carry one illegally. Most states that respect individuals rights have CCW permits available for law-abiding citizens. You can also get a small personal alarm keychain that will emit a high pitch siren like a car alarm when its pin is pulled, similar in design to a grenade. Consider taking a self-defense class if you live in a dangerous area and are concerned for your well being. Advertisement What Are An Attacker's Main Weak Spots?

The difference between walking away and becoming tomorrow's newspaper headline is how well you are prepared to protect yourself in a bad situation. You can prepare some simple techniques to defend yourself before and during an attack, whether it be a fight or an ambush, ensuring your safety. Steps Part 1 Part 1 of 4: Maintaining a Defensive Posture 1 Guard your face. If the attacker is trying to punch you or grab you from the front, put your hands on your forehead in a \"Not in the face!\" sort of gesture and hold your arms tight on your body. X Research source This may look like a weak defensive position, but that is to your advantage since it brings your opponent's guard down. In addition, this position protects your face and your ribs, two places you'll likely want to protect. 2 Stand with a wide base. Both left-to-right and back-to-front, keep your feet diagonal from each other in a kind of martial-arts stance. This will lessen your likelihood of getting knocked or pushed over. X Research source You stand the best chance of winning a fight and getting away if you stay upright. Avoid taking the scuffle to the ground at all costs. Advertisement 3 Assess your assailant. Look at their hands. If they were about to attack with their hands, they would have their hands out. However, if they are concealing a weapon, they will have them hidden or at their side. If you're attacked by a person with a knife or a gun, you need to try to avoid confrontation and get away. If it's impossible to avoid a fight, you need to end the confrontation with a high-impact attack as quickly as possible, then run for help. 4 Take the defensive posture of running. Unless your attacker is making it impossible, trying to get away is the only guarantee of your safety. If you can avoid a fight, avoid it and run away. Remember to never turn your back on an opponent. If you do this the opponent will use this as a chance to attack. Advertisement Part 2 Part 2 of 4: Defending Yourself from the Front 1 Go for the eyes and nose. If you have to end the fight as quickly as possible by striking first, strike hard, and strike as many times as you can, then run for help. Getting ambushed in an alley by a mugger isn't the time to worry about fighting honorably. Keep yourself safe by making the confrontation as quickly as possible. X Research source . The eyes and nose are the most sensitive soft spots on your attacker's face and are vulnerable to elbows, knees, and your forehead With the hardest part of your forehead, right near the hairline, try to smash your assailant's nose by tensing your neck and driving your forehead into the middle of their face. This is the quickest and most unexpected way to end a fight completely. However strong, experienced, or violent your attacker, it's very difficult to quickly recover from a hard head-butt to the nose. 2 Kick or grab the groin of an attacker. Bringing a knee sharply into the groin of an attacker or grabbing the groin with your hand and twisting is an instantly effective move that will take your attacker down. Again, this isn't the time to worry about fighting dirty. If your life is in danger, go for the groin. X Research source If this doubles up your opponent, consider smashing your knee into their nose to ensure that they'll be down for the count. 3 Stomp your heel. If your being attacked from the back, chances are the attacker has their arms around your upper half. If your wearing heels or shoes such as heavy heel boots, this is especially effective. Move your foot near the attacker's, lift your foot up and bring it down on their foot as hard as you can. If they let you go, run; if they don't, try the next idea. 4 Go for the kneecaps. If, for example, you are being choked, or your assailant has their hands up in your face, attacking their legs will give you the opportunity to open them up to more attacks, or allow you to escape. This is especially effective on larger attackers and easy to do from your guarded position. Kick at shins and knees soccer-style, with the instep of your foot. This is a quick and painful kick. In addition, if their legs are close enough, lift your knees into their inner leg (femoral nerve), outer leg, knee, or groin. These will break down your attacker and may disable them. 5 Follow up. Try to poke or press on the eyes. No one can defend an eye poke, regardless of your attacker's size. Clapping on the ears can stun or, if done perfectly, breaks the eardrums. In some cases you may also want to attack your attacker's neck. To effectively choke someone, do not do the typical Hollywood \"hands around the entire neck,\" but instead just put your thumb and fingers around the trachea (especially easy to find on men with large Adam's apples). Dig, drive, and sink your fingers into this notch and they will experience intense pain and probably fall down. Note that poking the eyes, breaking the eardrums, and choking someone can all be extremely harmful. Only do these actions in extreme circumstances in which your life may be in danger otherwise. 6 Fall onto your attacker if you lose your balance. If you fall, try to fall on top of your attacker. You'll want to avoid taking the fight to the ground at all costs, but if it's unavoidable, use your weight to your advantage. While falling, keep the pointy parts of your body pointy (your knees and your elbows) and aim for your attacker's groin, ribs, and neck. 7 Be prepared for an assault with a weapon. If an attacker attacks with a weapon, know where the weapon is effective. If your attacker has a knife, try to stay out of arm's length. If there is a gun, consider running and dodging from left to right. If you get a chance to leave safely, go for it. Be sure that you're safe from your opponent when you decide to stop defending yourself. In many cases, you can end the situation immediately by giving the attacker your wallet. This is a logical choice, especially if at knife or gunpoint. Your life is worth much more than the cash and cards you have on you. Toss the wallet away from you and run. Advertisement Part 3 Part 3 of 4: Defending Your Back 1 Deflect the hold. If an attacker tries to grab you from behind to choke you, press their forearm against your collarbone instead of trying to pull it directly off, which may be difficult if you're fighting with someone stronger than you. Put one hand above their elbow (on the forearm) and one hand below it (so your hands are on both sides of the elbow). Now, in one strong and determined movement, step and swing your entire body around like the arm is the hinge to your body's screen door. X Research source This will get you out of their choke and leave their head, ribs, and legs wide open to your counterattack. When your attacker is behind you, the shins are right behind your legs and primed for your stomping and raking. 2 Sit down. If the attacker is trying to pick you up from behind, drop your hips quickly and violently, as if you were plopping down on a love seat. This will make you harder to pick up and give you an extra moment to attack them and fend them off by stomping on their shins or repositioning for a frontal defense. 3 Get dirty. If the attacker is trying to choke you by wrapping his arms around your neck, bring the ball of your foot forward, as if you just kicked a soccer ball, and forcefully slam it into the area of their leg between their ankle and mid-leg, or the groin. This may break their leg or otherwise incapacitate your attacker. Advertisement Part 4 Part 4 of 4: Avoiding Confrontation 1 Understand the stages of a fight. Preparing for each stage in a confrontation can help you avoid eventually ending up in a physical fight. Avoiding a serious fight should be your main goal, so you need to be bigger and more aware of the situation than your opponent. The stages of conflict include: The wind up. This is the initial argument before the fight erupts. It might start out relatively harmless but escalate quickly and unexpectedly. Verbal threats. When the arguing brings in the threat of physical confrontation, try saying \"I'm going to _____\". Shoving or other prodding behavior. Attempts to get you to escalate a conflict into a full-blown fight usually start not with punches or kicks but with nose-to-nose intimidation tactics and shoves. It's still possible to walk away at this point without getting into a full-blown fight. The full-blown fight. You've stopped arguing and started throwing punches. X Research source 2 Take all verbal or directional paths to non-confrontation. Each of the lead-up steps above are opportunities to end the argument. One will inevitably lead to another unless one of you backs down, so try to back down. Actual physical confrontation should be your last line of defense. X Research source If you're in the middle of an argument, calm it down by lowering your voice. Macho dudes in a bar can escalate stupid things quickly but be ready to hug and buy you a drink by apologizing and distracting them. If you're calm, they'll cool down. If you're being ambushed by an attacker, you need to get where people can see you and help you. It's less likely that you'll be grievously harmed if you're on a busy street corner where people are passing by. The confrontation has less of a chance of escalating in public. 3 Avoid walking alone. If you've got a long walk home from the bus or train station at night after work, consider meeting a friend near the metro stop and walking together. Staying in groups is the safest way to avoid these kinds of situations. If you must walk alone, gloom onto another group of walkers and stick close by. You don't have to know them to find safety in numbers. 4 Arm yourself. Concealed handguns, mace, or pepper spray are all handy defense devices you should consider having at the ready. Knives and guns are dangerous weapons many consider useful, but can also be used against you if you're unprepared to use them yourself. Be very cautious and smart if you choose to carry a weapon and take the proper certification classes to make sure you know how to handle a weapon safely. Never carry one illegally. Most states that respect individuals rights have CCW permits available for law-abiding citizens. You can also get a small personal alarm keychain that will emit a high pitch siren like a car alarm when its pin is pulled, similar in design to a grenade.

However, the most powerful weapon in your self-defense arsenal might not be a martial art or a concealed firearm\u2014it's your ability to stay aware of your surroundings through situational awareness. In this article, we will delve into the significance of situational awareness and how it can be your primary weapon in self-defense. Situational Awareness: Your Primary Weapon in Self-Defense Understanding Situational Awareness: , often referred to as \"SA,\" is a state of mind where you are acutely attuned to your environment. It involves not only recognizing what's happening around you but also comprehending the potential threats and opportunities that exist within that context. Developing situational awareness is a skill that can be honed and refined over time. The Three Levels of Situational Awareness: Perception : At the first level, you observe your surroundings actively. This includes paying attention to details like people, objects, sounds, and movements in your vicinity. Perception is the foundation of situational awareness. Comprehension: Once you perceive your environment, the next step is to understand it. You analyze the information you've gathered to assess potential threats or opportunities. Are there any unusual behaviors or signs of danger? Projection : The highest level of situational awareness involves projection. This means using the information you've gathered and understood to predict future developments. You anticipate what might happen next and prepare accordingly. Situational Awareness Series How Situational Awareness Enhances Self-Defense: Early Threat Detection: Situational awareness allows you to spot potential threats or dangerous situations before they escalate. This early detection can provide valuable seconds for you to react appropriately. Effective Decision-Making: With a clear understanding of your environment, you can make informed decisions about how to respond to a threat. Situational awareness helps you choose the most appropriate self-defense strategy, whether it's evading, de-escalating, or taking physical action. : Being aware of your surroundings reduces the likelihood of being caught off guard. Ambushes and surprise attacks are less likely to succeed when you are alert and vigilant. Avoidance as a First Option : Situational awareness allows you to identify potentially dangerous situations early enough to avoid them altogether. This proactive approach is often the safest form of self-defense. Cultivating Situational Awareness: Practice Mindfulness: Train your mind to stay present and engaged in your surroundings. Minimize distractions and focus on what's happening around you. Use All Your Senses: Pay attention not only to what you see but also what you hear, smell, and feel. Your senses can provide valuable information about your environment. Stay Calm: Panic can hinder situational awareness. Practice maintaining a calm and composed mindset, even in stressful situations. Constant Vigilance: Cultivate the habit of being aware at all times, not just in potentially dangerous situations. The more you practice, the more automatic and effective your situational awareness becomes. Establishing a Baseline Establishing a baseline in situational awareness is a fundamental step in understanding your environment and recognizing deviations or anomalies that may indicate potential threats or changes. It involves creating a mental picture of what's \"normal\" in a given situation or environment. Here's how to establish a baseline effectively: 1. Observation and Awareness: Begin by actively observing your surroundings without any specific agenda. Take in the sights, sounds, smells, and activities around you. Pay attention to details like people's behavior, typical traffic patterns, and the general mood or atmosphere of the place. 2. Duration and Repetition: Spend some time in the environment to establish a baseline. The longer you observe, the more accurate your understanding of what's normal becomes. Repeated visits or experiences in the same setting will help you recognize patterns and variations. 3. Environmental Factors: Consider environmental factors, such as the time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions. These elements can influence what is considered normal. Different locations may have unique baselines; what's normal in a park during the day may not be the same as what's normal at a nightclub in the evening. 4. People and Behavior: Observe the people in the area, their interactions, and typical behavior. Are they relaxed, focused, hurried, or agitated? Take note of common activities, like people shopping in a mall, children playing in a park, or coworkers at the office. 5. Identify Anomalies: Once you've established a baseline, you'll be better equipped to recognize anomalies or deviations from what you consider normal. These anomalies could be subtle changes in behavior, unusual objects, or unexpected noises. Trust your instincts if something feels out of place or raises your suspicion. 6. Adapt and React: If you notice an anomaly that could indicate a potential threat or danger, it's essential to adapt your awareness level accordingly. Take proactive steps to ensure your safety, such as moving to a more secure location, alerting authorities, or adjusting your behavior to mitigate risks. 7. Continual Assessment: Situational awareness is not a one-time process; it requires continual assessment and adaptation. As circumstances change, your baseline may need to be adjusted. Stay aware and open to new information and be prepared to react as needed. Establishing a baseline in situational awareness helps you differentiate between what is normal and what might be cause for concern in your environment. By building this mental framework, you enhance your ability to recognize potential threats, react effectively, and prioritize your safety in various situations. OODA loop Situational Awareness The OODA loop, often referred to as the OODA decision cycle, is a tool developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd. It stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. The OODA loop describes the decision-making process that individuals or organizations go through in rapidly changing or dynamic situations, emphasizing the importance of agility and adaptability. Observe : The first step in the OODA loop involves gathering information about the environment, including identifying relevant cues, patterns, and changes. Observing the situation accurately and comprehensively is crucial for understanding the context and recognizing potential threats or opportunities. Orient : Once information is collected, individuals must orient themselves by interpreting and analyzing the observed data within the context of their existing knowledge, experience, and mental models. Orientation involves making sense of the information, assessing its significance, and determining its implications for decision-making. Decide : Based on their observations and orientation, individuals must make timely and informed decisions about how to respond to the situation. Decision-making involves weighing the available options, evaluating potential courses of action, and selecting the most appropriate strategy to achieve desired objectives. Act : The final step in the OODA loop is to implement the chosen course of action promptly and decisively. Acting effectively requires translating decisions into tangible behaviors or responses, executing plans with precision, and adapting to any unforeseen changes or obstacles encountered in the process. The OODA loop is iterative and continuous, meaning that it does not end with a single cycle but rather operates in a feedback loop. As individuals act on their decisions, the outcomes of those actions are observed, providing new information that feeds back into subsequent iterations of the loop. This iterative process allows individuals to rapidly adjust their actions in response to changing circumstances, maintain situational awareness, and maintain a competitive advantage over adversaries or opponents. While self-defense skills are essential, situational awareness is the foundation upon which effective self-defense is built. By developing this skill, you not only enhance your personal safety but also gain a powerful tool that can help you navigate the complexities of the modern world with confidence and vigilance. Situational awareness is not just about defending yourself physically; it's about empowering yourself mentally and emotionally to face the unknown with courage and intelligence.

However, the most powerful weapon in your self-defense arsenal might not be a martial art or a concealed firearm\u2014it's your ability to stay aware of your surroundings through situational awareness. In this article, we will delve into the significance of situational awareness and how it can be your primary weapon in self-defense. Situational Awareness: Your Primary Weapon in Self-Defense Understanding Situational Awareness: , often referred to as \"SA,\" is a state of mind where you are acutely attuned to your environment. It involves not only recognizing what's happening around you but also comprehending the potential threats and opportunities that exist within that context. Developing situational awareness is a skill that can be honed and refined over time. The Three Levels of Situational Awareness: Perception : At the first level, you observe your surroundings actively. This includes paying attention to details like people, objects, sounds, and movements in your vicinity. Perception is the foundation of situational awareness. Comprehension: Once you perceive your environment, the next step is to understand it. You analyze the information you've gathered to assess potential threats or opportunities. Are there any unusual behaviors or signs of danger? Projection : The highest level of situational awareness involves projection. This means using the information you've gathered and understood to predict future developments. You anticipate what might happen next and prepare accordingly. Situational Awareness Series How Situational Awareness Enhances Self-Defense: Early Threat Detection: Situational awareness allows you to spot potential threats or dangerous situations before they escalate. This early detection can provide valuable seconds for you to react appropriately. Effective Decision-Making: With a clear understanding of your environment, you can make informed decisions about how to respond to a threat. Situational awareness helps you choose the most appropriate self-defense strategy, whether it's evading, de-escalating, or taking physical action. : Being aware of your surroundings reduces the likelihood of being caught off guard. Ambushes and surprise attacks are less likely to succeed when you are alert and vigilant. Avoidance as a First Option : Situational awareness allows you to identify potentially dangerous situations early enough to avoid them altogether. This proactive approach is often the safest form of self-defense. Cultivating Situational Awareness: Practice Mindfulness: Train your mind to stay present and engaged in your surroundings. Minimize distractions and focus on what's happening around you. Use All Your Senses: Pay attention not only to what you see but also what you hear, smell, and feel. Your senses can provide valuable information about your environment. Stay Calm: Panic can hinder situational awareness. Practice maintaining a calm and composed mindset, even in stressful situations. Constant Vigilance: Cultivate the habit of being aware at all times, not just in potentially dangerous situations. The more you practice, the more automatic and effective your situational awareness becomes. Establishing a Baseline Establishing a baseline in situational awareness is a fundamental step in understanding your environment and recognizing deviations or anomalies that may indicate potential threats or changes. It involves creating a mental picture of what's \"normal\" in a given situation or environment. Here's how to establish a baseline effectively: 1. Observation and Awareness: Begin by actively observing your surroundings without any specific agenda. Take in the sights, sounds, smells, and activities around you. Pay attention to details like people's behavior, typical traffic patterns, and the general mood or atmosphere of the place. 2. Duration and Repetition: Spend some time in the environment to establish a baseline. The longer you observe, the more accurate your understanding of what's normal becomes. Repeated visits or experiences in the same setting will help you recognize patterns and variations. 3. Environmental Factors: Consider environmental factors, such as the time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions. These elements can influence what is considered normal. Different locations may have unique baselines; what's normal in a park during the day may not be the same as what's normal at a nightclub in the evening. 4. People and Behavior: Observe the people in the area, their interactions, and typical behavior. Are they relaxed, focused, hurried, or agitated? Take note of common activities, like people shopping in a mall, children playing in a park, or coworkers at the office. 5. Identify Anomalies: Once you've established a baseline, you'll be better equipped to recognize anomalies or deviations from what you consider normal. These anomalies could be subtle changes in behavior, unusual objects, or unexpected noises. Trust your instincts if something feels out of place or raises your suspicion. 6. Adapt and React: If you notice an anomaly that could indicate a potential threat or danger, it's essential to adapt your awareness level accordingly. Take proactive steps to ensure your safety, such as moving to a more secure location, alerting authorities, or adjusting your behavior to mitigate risks. 7. Continual Assessment: Situational awareness is not a one-time process; it requires continual assessment and adaptation. As circumstances change, your baseline may need to be adjusted. Stay aware and open to new information and be prepared to react as needed. Establishing a baseline in situational awareness helps you differentiate between what is normal and what might be cause for concern in your environment. By building this mental framework, you enhance your ability to recognize potential threats, react effectively, and prioritize your safety in various situations. OODA loop Situational Awareness The OODA loop, often referred to as the OODA decision cycle, is a tool developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd. It stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. The OODA loop describes the decision-making process that individuals or organizations go through in rapidly changing or dynamic situations, emphasizing the importance of agility and adaptability. Observe : The first step in the OODA loop involves gathering information about the environment, including identifying relevant cues, patterns, and changes. Observing the situation accurately and comprehensively is crucial for understanding the context and recognizing potential threats or opportunities. Orient : Once information is collected, individuals must orient themselves by interpreting and analyzing the observed data within the context of their existing knowledge, experience, and mental models. Orientation involves making sense of the information, assessing its significance, and determining its implications for decision-making. Decide : Based on their observations and orientation, individuals must make timely and informed decisions about how to respond to the situation. Decision-making involves weighing the available options, evaluating potential courses of action, and selecting the most appropriate strategy to achieve desired objectives. Act : The final step in the OODA loop is to implement the chosen course of action promptly and decisively. Acting effectively requires translating decisions into tangible behaviors or responses, executing plans with precision, and adapting to any unforeseen changes or obstacles encountered in the process. The OODA loop is iterative and continuous, meaning that it does not end with a single cycle but rather operates in a feedback loop. As individuals act on their decisions, the outcomes of those actions are observed, providing new information that feeds back into subsequent iterations of the loop. This iterative process allows individuals to rapidly adjust their actions in response to changing circumstances, maintain situational awareness, and maintain a competitive advantage over adversaries or opponents. While self-defense skills are essential, situational awareness is the foundation upon which effective self-defense is built. By developing this skill, you not only enhance your personal safety but also gain a powerful tool that can help you navigate the complexities of the modern world with confidence and vigilance. Situational awareness is not just about defending yourself physically; it's about empowering yourself mentally and emotionally to face the unknown with courage and intelligence.

I wish I had known this 20 or 30 years ago as it could have saved me from a lot of unfortunate situations. Please share with these self defence tips with other women in your lives to help keep more people safe. And, take action today - what can you do differently to keep yourself safer? Our online course \u2018Self Defence for Women\u2019 teaches life-saving techniques for any situation, read on to the end to find out more and how it can help you \u2026 Best Self Defence Tips for Women The biggest threat comes from people known to you You may be surprised to hear that the biggest threat of violence towards women comes from people known to you . Not from strangers, but from people you know and in most cases, people you love or have loved. Statistics show that roughly: 70 to 90% of violence is from our social circles 30% of violence is by a family member 10 to 30% of attacks come from strangers This could be a partner, ex-partner, family member, work colleague, neighbour or someone at a club, the gym or community group. At least 1 in 4 women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime. When you hear these shocking statistics and relate them to self defence, you can see that the \u2018old-school approach\u2019 of learning martial arts and focusing on kicking and punching isn\u2019t going to help in these situations. Real self defence is not just about the \u2018physical\u2019! Nine times out of ten, real self defence is about: Understanding how violence happens Knowing where your biggest threats lie Being mentally prepared that your loved one could become controlling and abusive Listening to your gut Acting on behavioural red flags Not making excuses for people Getting help at the first signs of mental or physical abuse. 2. MARTIAL ARTS AREN\u2019T EFFECTIVE SELF DEFENCE When most people think about self defence, they think about martial arts, boxing, Krav Maga, Jiu Jitsu etc. Well, the second thing women need to know about self defence is that martial arts aren\u2019t effective in real-life violent situations. Controversial, I know. Don\u2019t get us wrong, we\u2019re not saying don\u2019t learn martial arts. They are great for fitness, strength, discipline and for physical interaction. However, martial arts are not our recommended physical response in a violent scenario. Even though our instructor and street safety expert, Dene Josham, trained in Kickboxing and fought at a professional level (see pics belowwhen younger - sorry Dene!), martial arts are not his \u2018go-to\u2019 to defend himself. Why? Violence is messy, frenzied, nasty and up-close - there are no rules. There is no time to get into the \u2018right\u2019 position to deploy your kick or punch or use a wrist-lock, thumb-lock or any other manoeuvre. And, focusing on learning martial arts without the understanding of how and why violence happens - emotionally and physically - is ineffective. You need to understand when and how violence can be de-escalated and when and how to respond physically. Also, martial arts take years of dedication and practice to become proficient at. For the average woman who wants to learn to defend herself in case of a street attack, this is not a realistic or viable option. That\u2019s why the self defence we teach is simple, highly effective and can be learnt by anyone of any ability in a one-off workshop or short online course. 3. Awareness and avoidance is 95% of self defence We believe that 95% of self defence is awareness and avoidance. What we mean by this is that self defence is about not getting into a violent situation in the first place . Yes, there will always be occasions that can\u2019t be avoided but these are few and far between. For the most part, being aware of your environment and the people in it can help you avoid becoming a victim of violence. How? First of all, be aware that violence happens and understand how it happens. Do you know the difference between social and anti-social violence? Do you know how and when to use de-escalation techniques? If not, invest some time in learning - we have a range of affordable online courses that teach this, such as . Take your headphones off, put your phone away and tune in to what is happening around you Secondly, switch on and plug into the world around you: Take your headphones out Put your phone away Look what is going on Concentrate and tune in Observe and analyse people Take early evasive action if you notice something \u2018off\u2019. Many people avoid this subject altogether because it is horrible to think about. I get that but that approach won\u2019t keep you safe. 4. Develop a fierce mindset You are worth protecting. No one has the right to hurt you, emotionally or physically. You are strong, powerful and fierce. So many women that we train in self defence start off with a low self-esteem mindset. We\u2019ve been told things like: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens to me, as long as my children are ok.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no point fighting back because I\u2019m too small.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got no chance against a man because I\u2019m not strong enough.\u201d Wrong, wrong and wrong. It absolutely matters what happens to you - because if you\u2019re suffering emotionally or physically or, worst case scenario, you don\u2019t come home at all, who is going to look after your children, your dog, your mum, your sister? And, let\u2019s be crystal clear here - it does not matter what size you are or how strong you are or how big and tough the attacker is - you can defend yourself and win. So how can I defend myself against a man who is bigger and stronger than me? Start out by getting your mindset right. You must believe that you are worth protecting and get so damn angry with anyone who thinks they can attack you, that you know at a deep level that you will do whatever it takes to survive. How dare they think that they can hurt you? They have no right and you will show them that they have picked the wrong woman to assault. What\u2019s more, your physical response will be so fierce that you\u2019ll make them think twice before attacking another woman again. What is your reason to fight? Who do you want to go home to? Who or what needs you? How would people in your life feel if they lost you? Set this reason firmly in your mind and use it to switch into the fierce warrior, lioness, powerful woman that is within you. Remember the capability of the human body Women do amazing things every day and under extreme pressure women have done awesome things. Remember the two women (Donna McNamee and Abigail Sicolo) who lifted a 1-ton car off a boy trapped underneath Remember the mum (Lydia Angyiou) who fought off a 700-pound polar bear to protect her children Remember the young woman (Terra Newell) who was ambushed from behind and stabbed in the back by a man (who was over a foot taller than her and weighed 30 pounds heavier) who she fought off and killed Remember the female warriors who have fought alongside men throughout history - it is only in more modern times that women have been excluded from these things and labelled \u2018too weak\u2019 or \u2018too delicate\u2019 to fight. Determination and mindset are more important than strength - and when you add knowledge and ability into it - by learning the body\u2019s weak spots and how to use them effectively (see ), you are so powerful. 5. Trust your intuition This is one of the most important things we teach in self defence - trust your gut instinct. Your instinct or intuition is your body\u2019s internal warning system. Intuition developed over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution and it is there to keep us safe - if we listen to it and act on it. So, if you: Get an uneasy feeling that your date is \u2018too good to be true\u2019, you\u2019re probably right - be safe, don\u2019t commit, don\u2019t share personal information, walk away if you need to Sense that guy is following you, he probably is - cross the road, run away Don\u2019t trust the person asking you a question in the street - don\u2019t answer just say \u2018sorry\u2019 and get away Get a feeling in a crowd that something bad is going to happen - move to the edge of the crowd and walk away Feel uncomfortable when your partner wants too much detail about where you are going and wants you to do what they want, don\u2019t dismiss it - tell them that\u2019s not acceptable and talk to a friend for support. Try to tune in to your intuition It could be an uneasy feeling in your gut, butterflies in your tummy, goosebumps, tightness in the chest or a \u2018knowing\u2019 feeling that something bad is going to happen. Listen to it and act on it. Never tell yourself you are being silly. It\u2019s always better to get away and be wrong than to stay and become the victim of violence. 6. Know behavioural warning signs Notice, understand and act on behavioural changes in your loved ones and people you know. Out-of-character behaviour should be seen as a red flag and acted upon. This is linked to using your intuition and to knowing that the biggest threat of violence comes from people known to you. So, notice and take action if: Your partner starts paying more attention to you and questioning you a lot A creepy work colleague starts taking their lunch at the same time as you and sitting near you Your partner asks you not to go and see your mum because they need you more That guy from the gym starts walking home the same way you do Your partner tells you they don\u2019t like your friend and they don\u2019t want you to go out with them Your boss starts complimenting you in an uncomfortable way A loved one becomes very distant and grumpy with you Your partner starts drinking on weeknights and they haven\u2019t before. None of these things are easy to address but they must be addressed. If you don\u2019t, the behaviour is likely to escalate. If you don\u2019t know how to deal with the behaviour, talk to a friend, call a or seek professional support. Do you want to learn self defence and how to stay safe?

Also, always carry a weapon-whether pepper spray, mace, taser guns, or pocket knives. A gun if you are comfortable with that. BJJ is great for a smaller, weaker person to defend themselves against a larger attacker, but it takes a lot of training. Preview Post Reply Dene Josham 4 months ago Pending Awaiting Moderation \u00b7 0 Likes Hi, thanks for your feedback :) It will depend where you are in the world as to whether it is legal to carry a weapon, for example, the weapons you listed are all illegal in the UK.

They are shattering the glass ceilings, winning Olympic medals, becoming Head of States all on their own. So to make the lives of these awesome women safer, we\u2019ve put together a list of 10 tricks that all women should know to help them walk two inches taller in any situation that they might face. 1. Keep to busy roads 404 Not Found Always drive with all your doors locked and windows rolled up. If you are being followed on the road, remember to stay on busy streets with lots of people around so that help is imminent when needed. Parking your car in isolated places or leaving your car can be the worst mistake you can make. Drive to the nearest police station if your pursuer is persistent. 2. Keep an inflatable tyre kit in your car Dealing with a flat tyre in the middle of nowhere can be quite the nightmare. Instead of running around for a fix, keep an inflatable tyre kit in your trunk to help you take care of a flat in a jiffy! You can learn more about inflating car tires . 3.\u00a0Push back & yell loudly This the first thing you need to do as soon you realize that you are being stalked. If you sense trouble, act promptly. If attacked, push your assaulter aside and shout as loudly as you can. It might not dissuade them, but it will definitely make you seem like a difficult target. Also, it will rouse the attention of people around you and get help to you faster. 4. Use the heel of your palm to strike at the nose When you\u2019re cornered in a deserted area, a swift blow to the nose will help you escape. If your attacker is charging towards you, hit their nose with the heel of your palm using all the strength you\u2019ve got. This will cause immense pain and will temporarily disorient them, allowing you time to call for help or escape. 5. Use everyday objects as weapons You can fashion weapons out of anything around you. Like any other weapons, a set of keys wedged between your fingers like brass knuckles can deliver a crippling blow. If you are attacked at home, run to the kitchen and grab anything like a rolling pin, heavy ladle or a knife. Just remember to be quick! 6. Get out of a wrist-hold 404 Not Found Source: If your attacker has you in a wrist-hold, here\u2019s an easy way to break free. Instead of struggling, squat down, lean forward and then bend your elbows all the way towards their arm, till they can no longer hold on.\u00a0Or simply rotate your wrist to the point where their finger and thumb meet and yank your wrist free. Their grip will be the weakest at that point and a sharp tug will help you escape quickly. 7. Keep a bag of essentials in your car ADVERTISEMENT A car survival kit can be your best friend when you\u2019re driving long distances. Keep items like first aid kit, jumper cables, flashlight, a fully-charged power bank, matchbox, a thick rope etc. in your kit and you\u2019ll always be prepared to face any situation on the road. 8. Hit them with your elbows If the attacker is trying to pin your arms down, this can be a useful strike to incapacitate them with. So yank your arms free of their grapple and hit their head with your elbows as hard as you can.\u00a0With enough force to the temple, you elbows can potentially cause severe bruising and unconsciousness, crippling your attacker for several minutes. 9. Use pepper spray Nothing works more effectively than pepper spray to the face. Some formulations are powerful enough to cause tearing, irritation and even temporary blindness when sprayed directly into the eyes. This trick works best when your attacker is charging towards you. Keep a can of pepper spray in your purse and in the glove compartment of your car for emergencies. Learn how to use it properly . 10. Phone for help when your car breaks down A car breaking down in the middle of nowhere is the textbook example of a difficult situation, but with a little bit of common sense you can easily find a safe way out of the problem. When your car breaks down and you cannot figure it out on your own, simply get back inside, leave your headlights on, lock the doors, stay in & phone for help. Do not step out of the car till proper help has arrived. We are confident, fierce & bold. Our self-reliance gets us out of the stickiest of situations making us more than capable of taking care of ourselves. This is why Ford EcoSport is the perfect car for us.

Go back 4 Powerful Self-Defense Tips for Seniors To Stay Safe November 21, 20236 min read Reviewed by Dr. Matthew Delmonico Seniors are one of the most vulnerable targets for attackers, thieves, or fraudsters, and to stay safe and protected, learning some self-defense techniques and increasing awareness is crucial. Your Prescriptions Sorted and Delivered Robbery, fraud, and burglary are among the top crimes committed against older adults. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, aged 65 years and older encounter at least one form of abuse each year. Increasing awareness in seniors about certain self-defense strategies can prevent them from falling prey to attackers or thieves. In this article, we will explore strategies to avoid becoming a target and go over 4 powerful and actionable self-defense tips. Benefits of Self-Defense for Seniors Apart from protecting seniors from any damage or loss that attackers or thieves may cause, there are numerous other benefits of self-defense, including the following: Self-defense improves confidence in seniors, allows them to be more independent and bold, and encourages them to interact with the world by reducing their fear or anxiety. By learning self-defense tips, seniors become more aware and cautious of their surroundings. Self-defense awareness teaches seniors not to trust or talk to everyone, especially strangers. Self-defense training offers physical and mental health benefits, like improved strength, energy, and cognitive functions, and helps seniors stay in shape. How You Can Avoid Becoming a Target Before we move on to the best self-defense tips, it is also important to learn how you can prevent yourself from becoming a target in the first place. The foremost thing is to not create situations that may attract crime. This includes things such as counting money at an ATM, wearing expensive jewelry or watches, or carrying costly items like iPhones and expensive handbags. It is important to keep your body and head straight when you walk. Also, walk with purpose and confidence. Your eyes should scan the entire surroundings as you take your steps. If you appear weak or frightened and just roam around without a purpose, the chances of being targeted can increase. While walking alone, tightly hold your belongings close to your body tightly to prevent easy snatching. Keep doors and windows locked when at home, and do not open the door for anyone you don\u2019t know. If you have any significant physical health problems, avoid traveling or even walking alone outdoors. Carrying self-defense tools, like stun guns, pepper spray, walking sticks, and emergency whistles is another way to prevent certain crimes or abuse. Seniors can scare attackers with these tools and prevent them from snatching valuables or attacking. 4 Self-Defense Tips Even when you stay cautious and do your best to avoid becoming a target, you may still face situations where you need to practice self-defense. Hence, learning some of the best self-defense practices is crucial. Here are the top 4 self-defense tips and techniques that seniors can utilize when encountering a threat: MedBox: Never Sort Medications Again Make Noise When you face a potential attacker, it can be difficult to verbally make loud noises on your own because of fear or anxiety. A better option is to carry a loud or alarm in your pocket or attach it to your keychain. When you encounter a threat, you can pretend to take out your valuables, then quickly use the whistle or press the emergency alarm. Don\u2019t Resist Always remember, your life is more valuable than any expensive item you own. If you realize that the attacker is only interested in taking your belongings, don\u2019t resist. If you resist, it might lead to a fight, putting your life at risk. Losing cash and other items might be a temporary loss, but losing your life or ending up with health problems or disabilities may be long-lasting or permanent. Target Vulnerable Areas Despite your best efforts to avoid dangerous situations, you may still end up being attacked. When this happens, and you aren\u2019t sure how to defend yourself, targeting the attacker\u2019s vulnerable areas is another effective way to protect yourself. The most common vulnerable areas that you can target include the eyes, feet, groin (for men), neck, or knees. For example, you can poke the attacker\u2019s eyes with your fingers, car keys, walking stick, umbrella, or anything else you have. If the attacker is holding your hands, you can stomp their feet or kick them really hard on their knees. In some instances, you may render the attacker unconscious by using these techniques. If that happens, running away quickly before the attacker regains consciousness is important. Get Martial Arts Training Martial arts training is a highly effective form of self-defense for seniors willing to learn how to defend themselves physically. This type of training may be more suitable for seniors who possess good physical strength and balance. Below are some of the best martial arts for seniors: Cane-fu involves carrying a unique cane or walking stick that has specific features that make it more suitable for self-defense. For example, compared to normal canes, cane-fu or self-defense canes have a thicker shaft and are made of wood or other materials that are slightly heavy. Cane-fu is not only a self-defense tool but also a physical walking aid for seniors. To utilize it fully, it is good to get some training from certified instructors on how to use your cane as an effective weapon. Judo Judo is another effective martial art for self-defense. Judo teaches how to hold, throw, pin, or apply pressure to the arm joints or neck of the attacker. Learning and applying judo techniques is easy as it doesn\u2019t involve excessive punches, kicks, or other types of strikes. So, even if you have physical limitations, judo can be easy to learn. Wing Chun Wing Chun is a martial arts and self-defense skill that involves throws and punches. However, this self-defense technique commonly only works for individuals with a good body structure and enhanced physical strength. No More Pill Sorting!

Women are often more vulnerable to certain types of violence, including assault and robbery, and having the knowledge and tools to defend yourself can be life-saving. Aside from protecting yourself in dangerous situations, learning self-defense helps build confidence, improve situational awareness, and reduce fear in day-to-day life.\u00a0When you know how to react in critical moments, you are not only safer, but you are also mentally prepared to handle any challenges that come your way. Moreover, many self-defense techniques are simple to learn and can be applied without needing advanced strength or skill. These strategies can be applied by women of all ages and physical abilities, making self-defense accessible to everyone. 7 Self-Defense Tips All Women Need to Know to Stay Safe Self-defense is about more than just physical strength; it\u2019s about being proactive, aware, and confident. The following tips are practical and easy to incorporate into your daily routine, helping you stay safe and empowered in any situation. 1. Trust Your Instincts One of the most important aspects of women\u2019s self-defense is trusting your instincts. If something feels off or dangerous, your intuition is often the first warning sign. Whether you\u2019re walking to your car at night or in an unfamiliar place, listen to your gut. If you feel uncomfortable or sense danger, take action. Move to a safer location, alert someone, or avoid situations that feel risky. Developing this awareness and listening to your inner voice can help you prevent dangerous situations before they escalate. 2. Stay Aware of Your Surroundings Situational awareness is a key component of self-defense for women. Always be mindful of what\u2019s happening around you. Avoid distractions such as looking at your phone or wearing headphones while walking, as they can impair your ability to detect potential threats. By observing your environment, you\u2019ll notice exits, potential hazards, and the people around you, which can help you make informed decisions about your safety. A few seconds of awareness can make a significant difference in staying one step ahead of an attacker. 3. Use Your Voice Your voice is a powerful tool in self-defense. In moments of danger, yelling or screaming can startle an attacker and draw attention to the situation, possibly deterring them. Using strong, assertive commands such as \u201cBack off!\u201d or \u201cHelp!\u201d can stop an attacker in their tracks. If you\u2019re in a public place, shouting for help can attract attention from others, allowing you to escape or seek assistance. Practicing using your voice can give you the confidence to react immediately in a high-stress situation. 4. Learn Basic Self-Defense Moves Taking a self-defense class is one of the best ways to equip yourself with practical skills for staying safe. Basic techniques such as how to break free from grabs, how to use leverage to defend yourself, and how to target vulnerable areas (like the eyes, nose, and groin) can significantly improve your ability to protect yourself. Self-defense training also boosts confidence and provides valuable knowledge on how to react during an attack. Many classes focus on simple, effective techniques that anyone can learn and apply, regardless of size or strength. 5. Carry Personal Safety Tools Personal safety tools can be a game-changer in self-defense situations. Items like pepper spray, stun guns, or personal alarms are lightweight, portable, and easy to use. These tools can disable an attacker long enough to allow you to escape or alert others. Carrying these devices in your bag, on your keychain, or in your pocket ensures you\u2019re always prepared for emergencies. Make sure to familiarize yourself with how each tool works and practice using it, so you can react swiftly and effectively if needed. 6. Stay in Well-Lit and Busy Areas When possible, always try to stay in well-lit and populated areas, especially when walking alone or traveling at night. Areas with good lighting and more people around are less attractive to potential attackers, as there is a greater chance of someone noticing suspicious activity. Avoid shortcuts through alleys, parks, or . If you must be out late, consider using public transportation, rideshare services, or walking with a friend. Staying in busy areas increases your chances of finding help quickly and reduces your vulnerability to dangerous situations. 7. Practice Escape Techniques In many self-defense scenarios, escaping the situation is the best option. Knowing how to break free from an attacker\u2019s hold or how to use your surroundings to your advantage can make all the difference. Practice techniques that allow you to create space, such as kneeing your attacker in the groin or using your elbows to strike. Additionally, practicing escape moves like running toward a crowd or finding a safe space can help you think quickly and act decisively in the event of an attack. Remember, getting away safely is often the best course of action. The Bottom Line Women\u2019s self-defense is not just about physical protection; it\u2019s about being aware, prepared, and confident. By following these 7 practical tips, you can improve your safety and be ready to respond if ever faced with danger. Remember, self-defense is a skill that anyone can learn, and the more you practice, the more empowered you\u2019ll feel in everyday situations.

Whether you're a student rushing to class or a professional balancing errands and work, staying prepared is crucial to your safety. This guide shares critical urban safety tips that can help you feel secure while exploring the complexities of city life. Understanding Your Surroundings Before you step outside, take a moment to understand the area you will be visiting. Knowing major streets, public transport routes, and key landmarks helps you stay oriented. For example, if you are going to a new neighborhood, spend a few minutes on mapping apps to highlight safe routes. Studies show that familiarity with your surroundings can reduce stress and boost confidence. A simple check of a city map can transform a confusing trek into an enjoyable stroll. A bustling urban street showing the flow of pedestrian traffic. Plan Your Routes Planning your route is essential for safety. Inform someone you trust about your plans, including your expected route and estimated arrival time. Choose well-lit areas, particularly after dark. For instance, walking through bustling streets can enhance your sense of security. If using public transport, try to arrive at stops a few minutes earlier. The National Crime Prevention Bureau reports that almost 50% of crimes occur in poorly lit areas. Keep your phone charged so that you can access maps and stay connected. Stay Observant Maintain heightened awareness while moving through the city. Avoid distractions such as excessive phone use or wearing headphones, as these can hinder your ability to notice important details. Practice scanning your environment regularly. Pay attention to people around you and their behavior. For example, if someone seems to be watching you or following you, change direction or find a public place. A statistic from the Urban Institute reveals that being aware of your surroundings can lower the likelihood of becoming a target for crime by nearly 40%. Outdoor caf\u00e9 scene showing people enjoying their time and engaging with each other. Personal Items Protection Protecting your belongings is crucial. It is easy for thieves to target people who are careless with their possessions. Use bags with secure closures and consider wearing them across your body. This keeps them close and less accessible to opportunistic thieves. Avoid displaying expensive items or large amounts of cash. For example, carrying small change instead of a wallet can deter unwanted attention. If you feel pressured or uncomfortable, it's essential to trust your instincts and create space between you and anyone who seems too intrusive. Trust Your Instincts Your intuition can be a powerful guide when navigating urban spaces. If someone makes you feel uneasy, don\u2019t hesitate to change your route or move towards a group of people. Feel free to enter a shop or caf\u00e9 and ask for assistance if you feel threatened. Most retailers are willing to help. Remember, prioritizing your safety is key. In fact, a study from the University of California indicates that trusting your instincts can enhance your personal safety by up to 50%. Emergency Preparedness Prepare for emergencies by keeping local emergency contact numbers handy. Knowing how to reach police and emergency services can save valuable time in a crisis. Carrying a personal safety device, like a whistle, can also provide an added layer of security. Additionally, consider downloading safety apps that share your location with trusted contacts in case of emergencies. Use Public Transport Wisely Public transport can be convenient, but it presents unique safety challenges. When using a bus or train, choose seats near exits or among other passengers. For example, sitting close to the driver or conductor is often a safer choice. Always keep an eye on your belongings and avoid showing valuables. If you find yourself waiting for a ride, stay in well-lit areas. Whenever possible, travel with a friend, particularly during late-night rides. Keep Emergency Numbers Ready Keeping emergency numbers readily available on your phone is essential. This list should include local police, fire department, and a trusted friend's contact. Also, it is wise to carry a portable charger. An Ohio State University study found that having a reliable way to keep your phone charged during emergencies can triple your chances of getting help in time. Be Wary of Public Spaces While many public areas are generally safe, some can pose risks. Before settling into a park or plaza, assess the surroundings. Look for well-maintained spaces with visible staff or security. Avoid areas that seem deserted or neglected. Statistics indicate that crimes in urban parks are notably lower when the area is well-monitored and maintained. Understanding where to relax can greatly influence your safety.

But being uneasy doesn\u2019t mean you need to stay home and miss the good times with your friends. Being prepared, planning your route, and knowing what to do in an emergency will make your night out safe, as well as fun. googleads.g.doubleclick.net googleads.g.doubleclick.net is blocked This page has been blocked by an extension Try disabling your extensions. ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT Reload This page has been blocked by an extension Steps Part 1 Part 1 of 3: Being Prepared 1 Tell someone where you are going. Before you leave home, let someone know where you are going and when you expect to be back. You might also want to send them a quick text when you arrive at your destination. If they don\u2019t receive your text, or you don\u2019t arrive home when expected, they can check to make sure everything is OK. You can also download an app such as FindMyFriends that allows you to share your location with others, as well as find friends nearby. Several of these apps also contain ways to quickly broadcast your location in an emergency situation. 2 Plan your travel route. By knowing exactly how you are getting to your destination, you will reduce your travel time and reduce the chances of getting lost in an unfamiliar area. You will also feel and appear confident, which reduces your chance of being approached by troublemakers. Advertisement 3 Charge your cell phone. Always have a fully charged cell phone with you. If you are in trouble, you can quickly call for help. You might also need your phone to use mapping or other functions to get you to your destination safely. 4 Invest in a whistle. A simple whistle is often the easiest way to chase off troublemakers. Pepper spray, which will incapacitate an attacker, is also an option if it is legal in your area, but make sure you check that it definitely is legal first before you bring one with you. The last thing you want to happen when out is to be searched by a police officer then arrested for possessing an offensive weapon. Pepper spray needs a little practice to use correctly. Get comfortable using your thumb to push the button so you can hold the canister securely in the palm of your hand with the other four fingers. Learn how to unlock the safety switch quickly. Practice a few times with your canister to learn how far away you can stand and still reach your target. Some sprays can reach up to ten feet. 5 Carry a small flashlight. Keep a mini flashlight on your keychain, where it will always be with you. It will provide light in extra dark areas and give you more confidence. Or learn to use the built-in torch on your phone. You can download a flashlight app if your phone doesn't have a built-in option. 6 Find another means of transportation if possible. If a situation is dangerous or uncomfortable for you, find another way to get home. This includes public transportation, getting a taxi, or calling a friend to drive you home. Make sure you are waiting in a well-lit area. Advertisement Part 2 Part 2 of 3: Getting to Your Destination 1 Travel with a friend or in a group. There truly is safety in numbers, as criminals are less likely to attack a group than an individual. If you are going out alone, you can use an app such as Map My Friends to find friends nearby to meet up with. Or check your university message board to find others looking to go out. Many cities and universities provide free shuttles around town to popular restaurants and clubs. Using this option provides a safe way to get to and from your destination. Another popular option with college students is a \"call a buddy\" system that has volunteers on-call to walk you home. 2 Stay away from unsafe places at night. Areas like this include dark alleyways, areas bordered by thick vegetation, places with few or no people around, and areas with low levels of light. If you can, stay away from these areas whenever possible. The likelihood of you becoming a victim of crime drastically increases when you enter unsafe areas. 3 . Enter a building or board public transportation with confidence. Walk with your head up. Not only will it help you see what is happening around you, but it will give you an air of confidence that will prevent assailants from approaching you as a weak and easy target. Be confident but don\u2019t attract the wrong kind of attention. Flashy jewelry, large purses, expensive clothing and attention-grabbing antics can make you a target. 4 Be aware of your surroundings. Look around while you walk and pay attention to what is going on around you. It will give you an early warning if someone is looking to make trouble. You\u2019ll want to avoid earphones and any article of clothing, such as a hoodie, that might interfere with your hearing or vision. You don\u2019t want to be distracted by chatting on your phone when walking, but it can sometimes make you feel safer to talk to someone when you are alone so they know where you are. Just make sure the conversation allows you to keep track of those around you. 5 Follow a familiar route. Traveling at night, especially if you are alone, isn\u2019t the time to try to take new routes or shortcuts through unfamiliar neighborhoods. If you must venture into unfamiliar territory, make sure you have determined a route ahead of time so you don't end up lost. 6 Stay in the well-lit areas. Walk or drive in well-lit, highly visible areas. Even if it takes you longer, stay on a well-lit route rather than taking shortcuts down dark roads or paths. Stick to streets populated with houses and shops rather than empty lots or vacant stores. Park in well-lit areas, as well. If it is still light when you park, visualize what the area will look like in the dark when you return. Look for overhead lights and park there. Always take note of where you park so that you can easily find your car. 7 Carry keys in your hand. When walking home or going back to your car at the end of the evening, have your keys in your hand to allow quick entry into your home or car. 8 Trust your instincts. If a situation feels sketchy, don\u2019t be embarrassed to leave or ask for help. Your instincts are there to protect you. 9 Be aware of strangers. If you see someone who is suspicious to you, or if you get a bad feeling, escape the situation. You are not obligated to be with anyone who disturbs you. Be aware of your surroundings, and be careful of people who ask for help. Sometimes, pleas for help are an attempt to play on your sympathy. Advertisement Part 3 Part 3 of 3: Handling an Emergency 1 Have a plan. Know what you plan to do and where you will go in case of trouble. This plan should include who you will call if you need someone to pick you up. You should also be familiar with safe places along your route that you can run to if needed. 2 Stay calm. If confronted, stay calm and confident. Being calm will give you a chance to assess the situation. If your assailants simply want property, it is often safest to give it to them. If they want to cause harm, you need to get away. Run if you can. If you can\u2019t get away, fight as hard as you can. Aim to inflict pain by lashing out at eyes, the bridge of the nose, knees and groin.

If you're living in a dangerous neighborhood, get as much security as you can. If you can afford getting a security camera, that's good. If you have some sort of security system, that's even better. Have some sort of handheld weapon next to you just in case, and make sure your phone is working so you can call 911. And just be aware of your environment without getting paranoid. Thanks!

Telling people what to do is more effective than yelling something like, \u201cFire.\u201d Instead, yell, \u201cI\u2019m being attacked \u2013 call 911!\u201d Or yell directly at the attacker: \u201cGet your hand off me!\u201d or even just \u201cStop!\u201d 4 Get to a safe place. As soon as you can, get to a safe place, such as a shop or nearby house. Call the police and report the incident. Include details of the confrontation, as well as a description of the perpetrator.

If you're living in a dangerous neighborhood, get as much security as you can. If you can afford getting a security camera, that's good. If you have some sort of security system, that's even better. Have some sort of handheld weapon next to you just in case, and make sure your phone is working so you can call 911. And just be aware of your environment without getting paranoid. Thanks!

The combination of darkness and fewer people around can create a sense of vulnerability. For women and seniors in particular, taking the right precautions is essential to ensuring safety while navigating urban streets. A published in the Journal of Urban Safety found that individuals walking in well-lit areas during nighttime outings are significantly less likely to experience criminal activity or accidents. Visibility is key to preventing unsafe situations. In this blog, we will share some vital safety tips to keep in mind during nighttime outings as well as how technology, like personal alarms, can play a role in enhancing your safety. 1. Plan Ahead for Your Route Planning your route before heading out can drastically reduce risks associated with urban environments. Stick to well-lit, populated streets and avoid alleys or poorly lit areas, especially in unfamiliar neighbourhoods. The presence of streetlights, stores, and residential buildings provides an added layer of security by increasing visibility and the likelihood that help will be nearby if needed. Why it matters: Staying in well-lit areas and avoiding isolated streets significantly reduces the chance of encountering unsafe situations. Visibility not only makes you less of a target but also makes it easier for people to notice if something is wrong, increasing your chances of receiving help if needed. If you need to use public transportation, check the schedules ahead of time to avoid long waits at dark, isolated bus stops or train stations. Being prepared and having a clear plan can help you feel more confident and in control of your surroundings. 2. Stay Aware of Your Surroundings One of the most effective safety strategies is staying alert. Avoid distractions, such as texting or looking at your phone, when walking at night. Criminals are more likely to target individuals who seem distracted, as they appear to be easy targets. Keep your head up, make eye contact with others, and be aware of any unusual activity around you. Why it matters: Being fully aware of your surroundings allows you to quickly identify any potential threats. By staying focused and attentive, you lower the risk of becoming a victim of crime or an accident, giving you more control over your environment and actions. 3. Carry a Personal Alarm or Safety Device For women and seniors, carrying a personal alarm can make a huge difference in emergency situations. Personal alarms, like the , are compact, easy to use, and provide a loud sound that can attract attention in case of danger. Simply pulling the pin or pressing the button activates a distress signal that can alert people nearby to your location. Carrying an alarm gives you the confidence that if you are ever in a precarious situation, you can quickly signal for help. Whether you're walking alone or in a group, a personal alarm can be a lifesaver. Why it matters: A personal alarm offers immediate assistance by drawing attention to your situation. In an emergency, signalling for help quickly can be crucial, and this small, easy-to-carry device can play a crucial role in ensuring you're not left alone in a vulnerable moment. 4. Walk with a Friend or Group If possible, try to walk with a friend or in a group. There's safety in numbers, and you\u2019re less likely to be targeted when you're accompanied by others. Walking with a companion also allows you to keep each other alert to your surroundings and provide support if needed. Why it matters: Travelling with others not only makes you more visible, but it also reduces the chances of being singled out as an easy target. Having a group around you not only increases your visibility but also makes it more difficult for anyone with ill intentions to approach you. 5. Avoid Carrying Valuables When out for a nighttime outing, try not to carry expensive jewellery, large amounts of cash, or other valuables that may make you a target for theft. Keep your purse or bag close to your body, and consider using a cross-body strap for added security. It's also a good idea to avoid using your phone in a way that might make it obvious you're not paying attention to your surroundings. Why it matters: Carrying valuables can make you an easy target for theft. By keeping your belongings secured and out of sight, you're less likely to attract unwanted attention or fall victim to opportunistic crime. 6. Trust Your Instincts If something feels off or unsafe, trust your instincts. Women and seniors often have a heightened sense of intuition that can be a valuable tool in avoiding dangerous situations. If you feel uncomfortable with someone nearby or notice suspicious activity, don't hesitate to change your route, enter a store or building, or call someone for reassurance. Why it matters: Your intuition is a powerful tool. It's advisable to take precautions if something doesn't feel right. Listening to your gut can help you avoid situations before they escalate, ensuring you stay in control of your safety. 7. Stay in Touch with Someone You Trust Before heading out for a nighttime outing, let someone know your whereabouts and expected return time. You could send a quick text or share your live location with a trusted friend or family member. If you're out for an extended period, periodically check in with them to keep communication open. Why it matters: Keeping someone informed of your plans ensures that someone will be able to check in if you don\u2019t return as expected. Having someone on standby to call for help can be crucial in the event that something goes wrong. 8. Dress Appropriately for the Environment Dress in comfortable shoes and clothing that allow you to move freely. Avoid clothing that is too tight or restrictive, as it can slow you down if you need to react quickly. Additionally, bright or reflective clothing can make you more visible to drivers and other pedestrians, which is especially important when walking in dimly lit areas. Why it matters: Wearing practical clothing that enables quick movement and visibility increases your chances of staying safe. In emergencies, the ability to move quickly or be easily seen can prevent accidents and reduce the chances of danger. Conclusion Navigating urban environments at night requires a combination of preparation, awareness, and precaution. Whether you\u2019re walking for exercise, socialising, or simply going about your daily routine, keeping these safety tips in mind can help you enjoy your outing with peace of mind. Remember, safety isn't about living in fear\u2014it's about being smart, confident, and prepared. Taking small steps like carrying a personal alarm, trusting your instincts, and staying aware of your surroundings can make a huge difference in protecting yourself.

With fewer people around, the dark nights give cover to criminals and predators, decrease our visibility and even familiar routes look different. Whilst avoiding going out alone on dark nights would be preferable, this isn\u2019t an option for many people who need to commute to and from work. So, what can you do to stay safer on dark nights? Take a look at our 7 step guide to dark night safety. SURVEY ON DARK NIGHT SAFETY We asked 100 people about their views on dark night safety. People answered from across the UK\u00a0of all ages and genders. This is is what they told us: 71% of people felt 'not safe' or 'not at all safe' out on their own in the dark 6% of people said they would never go out on their own at night as they were too scared 69% of people try their best to avoid going out on their own at night 23% of people said going out in the dark didn't bother them Comments included: \"I and other female friends will not go for walks unaccompanied. This issue is not being taken seriously enough by politicians and police\" \"Poorly lit car parks are the worst or people who don\u2019t realise they are walking really close immediately behind you\" \"I'm 5 ft 3\" an attack on myself would more than likely be someone taller and stronger than me. I live inner city so I avoid being out alone in the dark when I can\u201d \"It is a difficult judgement to make. On one hand, I try not to go out alone late at night because I am more vulnerable to an attack. On the other hand, I don't like to limit my life by being overly anxious. Often I have no choice if I want to go somewhere at night - I have to walk because I don't drive. So deciding not to walk alone at night often means deciding not to go out at all.\" Here's the thing, we can't live in fear as prisoners in our own homes because we are too scared to go out at night. But on the other hand, there are threats out there and the darkness gives cover and opportunity to criminals and predators. We know this as fact from statistics and accounts of people who have been attacked. So what's\u00a0the answer? As with most things in life, it's all about balance. Let's acknowledge\u00a0the facts - yes there are elements of society who prey on victims at night. To say that\u00a0it is completely safe out there is, in our view, burying your head in the sand and hiding from\u00a0reality. When you do go out at night on your own, make sure you have prepared yourself to be as safe as possible. The chances of being attacked by a stranger are small (but real) and\u00a0some simple tips and knowledge can help you avoid becoming a victim. Want to know the tips for how to stay safer on dark nights? Here we go \u2026 1. Plan ahead \u201cIf you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!\u201d You may have heard this quote before and it 100% applies to your personal safety. You must put some time and thought into where you are going, what time it will be, whether it will be dark etc. We suggest that people play the \u2018What if \u2026?\u2019 game. Ask yourself, What if my train is late? What if I think someone is following me? What if my car breaks down? etc. Having answers to these questions means you have a good plan in place and can react quickly and positively if it happens. Always think ahead and plan your journey: Know your route Have a plan B Don\u2019t take the secluded shortcut! Much of this stuff is common sense but you\u2019d be surprised how many people tell us they\u2019ve been attacked after doing something they just knew felt wrong. Like taking the shortcut across a dimly lit park at night - one person who attended our training said they did this and were mugged by a gang. Then they did it a second time, thinking it probably wouldn\u2019t happen again, and it did! Hopefully, after learning more on the training, they won\u2019t take unnecessary risks again. If you don\u2019t know the area you are travelling to, research whether there are any crime hotspots. Here is a website for doing this in the UK: 2. Be Prepared This motto of thousands of scouts and girl guides has it spot on! \u2018Be Prepared!\u2019 If you are travelling alone at night make sure you have everything prepared and ready, including: A fully charged mobile Panic App on your phone Check out Life 360 - this allows your chosen circle of family or friends to track where you are, receive notifications, and you can even use the panic button to contact people in an emergency. NB. A Panic App is good to have but don\u2019t rely on it. Your phone may not work or the people you contact may not have their phones on. A list of emergency numbers on paper in your pocket Just in case your phone is lost, the battery goes dead or is stolen. Do you know anyone\u2019s number by heart? Most people don\u2019t, so how would you call for help? Put a personal attack alarm on your bag or in your pocket Test that it works and have it somewhere you can easily set it off. I.e. not in the bottom of your bag! NB. A personal alarm is great to have but again, don\u2019t rely on it. It might not work when activated, people might not come when they hear it and in some cases, you might not get chance to activate it. Wear appropriate clothing Think about your footwear - could you run in it to get away? Perhaps you need to take a change of shoes with you. What is the weather like? Do you need a coat or umbrella? Or will you end up sheltering somewhere you don\u2019t want to be as it is raining? Will you be seen by cars? Think about something with reflective strips on. Take a small, powerful torch in your pocket Hopefully, the routes you choose will be well-lit but this isn\u2019t always the case. Having a torch will not only help you avoid tripping up but it gives you a few extra seconds warning if someone is coming or hiding. A powerful torch which lights up the street (such as a Maglite) also makes you look prepared and confident, which is often a turn-off to a criminal looking for an easy target. Although your phone has a torch, we prefer a proper torch. Walking along with your phone out is an invitation to a thief to snatch it. There are approximately 10,000 mobile phone snatchings in London every month. Don\u2019t be one of them! Avoid advertising your phone and making it easy for thieves. 3. BE PRESENT Next time you are out and about, take a look at how many people are walking along in their own world completely oblivious to what is happening around them. Are you one of them? This is a huge part of staying safe! Being present and switched on to your environment and the people around you is key to self defence and to noticing if anyone is watching or following you. Take your headphones out Put your phone away Stop daydreaming, planning and thinking about what happened at work Focus on your surroundings and the people around you. By looking around and tuning in, you are making yourself a more undesirable target to a predator who wants to catch someone unaware. 4. KEEP IN CONTACT Does a friend or family member know where you are and when you are expected back? If you\u2019ve been out with friends, check in on each other to make sure everyone gets home safely. Have a plan in place for what to do if you haven\u2019t heard from your friend that they\u2019re home safe. Do you have their partner or family\u2019s contact details? If you feel threatened or nervous, call someone you trust from a safe place. 5. TRUST YOUR GUT INSTINCT This is one of the first things we teach in our self defence training as it is critical to avoiding danger. Us humans have an awesome built-in warning alarm - our gut instinct! But so many of us switch it off or don\u2019t listen to it due to social conditioning or fear of upsetting someone. Don\u2019t ignore your gut instinct! Listen to what your body is telling you You know when something isn\u2019t quite right You know when there is \u2018something off\u2019 about a person You know when there is a bad vibe about a place When your body tells you something is wrong, act on it and get away. This could mean taking pre-emptive action when you sense someone is following you such as: Changing direction Crossing the road Running away Activating a personal alarm Calling for help or for a taxi Going into a cafe, shop or safe space Knocking on someone\u2019s door Flagging down a car. Obviously, you don\u2019t want to get into a car with a stranger or go into someone\u2019s house, but getting involvement from other people gives safety in numbers and you then have the opportunity to ask if you can wait with them until help arrives. And, getting other people involved might well deter the opportunist or criminal. 6. BE STREETWISE Sometimes the small things can make the difference in whether someone selects you as their victim. Ensuring you are streetwise makes you a harder target. Walk confidently Keep your head up, make brief eye contact with people This is not confrontational eye contact, but rather a quick glance to let them know you\u2019ve seen them. Walk in the direction of oncoming traffic So cars can\u2019t pull up behind you without you knowing. Think about the route in front of you - could someone be hiding? Is there enough space between you and any alleyways or parked vehicles. There may be occasions when you need to walk in the road to avoid squeezing between a van and a hedge, for example. Keep your hands free Don\u2019t carry lots of bags. You may need your hands to defend yourself. If you have no other option than to carry bags, be aware that they could be the target for a thief. Be prepared to let them go - they\u2019re not worth fighting over. Or if someone is attacking you for other reasons, such as a sexual assault, be ready to drop your bags so you can respond physically or run away faster. Hide valuables such as phones, watches, jewellery etc. If you have a journey to make at night and you don\u2019t know the area, perhaps that isn\u2019t the time to wear your designer handbag and expensive shoes. Have your keys ready before you get to your car or front door Messing around in your bag gives the perpetrator an opportunity where you are distracted. Having your torch ready at this point means you aren\u2019t fumbling around in the dark and can check if someone is hiding near your doorway. Stay in public, well-lit areas if possible 7. LEARN SELF DEFENCE How much time and resources have you spent on keeping yourself safe? Probably not a lot. It\u2019s so easy to put our focus on the fun things in life, spending thousands on holidays, days out, restaurants, clothes, homes, jewellery etc. However, when it comes to safety many people prefer to \u2018hope for the best\u2019 or think \u2018it won\u2019t happen to me\u2019. Some people even think \u2018what\u2019s the point?\u2019 \u2018what can I do?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not strong enough\u2019. But that\u2019s not an effective strategy for staying safe. And, believe us (we know), recovering from the trauma of an attack is all-encompassing and life-changing. So many people come to us after an attack to learn self defence as it\u2019s only then that they realise what an important life skill it is. If you\u2019re reading this now and you don\u2019t know how to defend yourself physically, take action! Self defence is a skill that everyone should have We have starting from \u00a324 where you can learn the basics of self defence in under an hour. Is your safety worth that investment? If you want more in-depth self defence classes, we have or you can book a private self defence workshop for your , , or .

With fewer people around, the dark nights give cover to criminals and predators, decrease our visibility and even familiar routes look different. Whilst avoiding going out alone on dark nights would be preferable, this isn\u2019t an option for many people who need to commute to and from work. So, what can you do to stay safer on dark nights? Take a look at our 7 step guide to dark night safety. SURVEY ON DARK NIGHT SAFETY We asked 100 people about their views on dark night safety. People answered from across the UK\u00a0of all ages and genders. This is is what they told us: 71% of people felt 'not safe' or 'not at all safe' out on their own in the dark 6% of people said they would never go out on their own at night as they were too scared 69% of people try their best to avoid going out on their own at night 23% of people said going out in the dark didn't bother them Comments included: \"I and other female friends will not go for walks unaccompanied. This issue is not being taken seriously enough by politicians and police\" \"Poorly lit car parks are the worst or people who don\u2019t realise they are walking really close immediately behind you\" \"I'm 5 ft 3\" an attack on myself would more than likely be someone taller and stronger than me. I live inner city so I avoid being out alone in the dark when I can\u201d \"It is a difficult judgement to make. On one hand, I try not to go out alone late at night because I am more vulnerable to an attack. On the other hand, I don't like to limit my life by being overly anxious. Often I have no choice if I want to go somewhere at night - I have to walk because I don't drive. So deciding not to walk alone at night often means deciding not to go out at all.\" Here's the thing, we can't live in fear as prisoners in our own homes because we are too scared to go out at night. But on the other hand, there are threats out there and the darkness gives cover and opportunity to criminals and predators. We know this as fact from statistics and accounts of people who have been attacked. So what's\u00a0the answer? As with most things in life, it's all about balance. Let's acknowledge\u00a0the facts - yes there are elements of society who prey on victims at night. To say that\u00a0it is completely safe out there is, in our view, burying your head in the sand and hiding from\u00a0reality. When you do go out at night on your own, make sure you have prepared yourself to be as safe as possible. The chances of being attacked by a stranger are small (but real) and\u00a0some simple tips and knowledge can help you avoid becoming a victim. Want to know the tips for how to stay safer on dark nights? Here we go \u2026 1. Plan ahead \u201cIf you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!\u201d You may have heard this quote before and it 100% applies to your personal safety. You must put some time and thought into where you are going, what time it will be, whether it will be dark etc. We suggest that people play the \u2018What if \u2026?\u2019 game. Ask yourself, What if my train is late? What if I think someone is following me? What if my car breaks down? etc. Having answers to these questions means you have a good plan in place and can react quickly and positively if it happens. Always think ahead and plan your journey: Know your route Have a plan B Don\u2019t take the secluded shortcut! Much of this stuff is common sense but you\u2019d be surprised how many people tell us they\u2019ve been attacked after doing something they just knew felt wrong. Like taking the shortcut across a dimly lit park at night - one person who attended our training said they did this and were mugged by a gang. Then they did it a second time, thinking it probably wouldn\u2019t happen again, and it did! Hopefully, after learning more on the training, they won\u2019t take unnecessary risks again. If you don\u2019t know the area you are travelling to, research whether there are any crime hotspots. Here is a website for doing this in the UK: 2. Be Prepared This motto of thousands of scouts and girl guides has it spot on! \u2018Be Prepared!\u2019 If you are travelling alone at night make sure you have everything prepared and ready, including: A fully charged mobile Panic App on your phone Check out Life 360 - this allows your chosen circle of family or friends to track where you are, receive notifications, and you can even use the panic button to contact people in an emergency. NB. A Panic App is good to have but don\u2019t rely on it. Your phone may not work or the people you contact may not have their phones on. A list of emergency numbers on paper in your pocket Just in case your phone is lost, the battery goes dead or is stolen. Do you know anyone\u2019s number by heart?

        "markdown": "After Dark Safety Tips by \\| Nov 14, 2023 \\| \\| Fall has arrived. It is getting dark earlier every day. Safety after dark is an important consideration, as the risk of certain types of incidents may increase during nighttime hours. Whether you are in an urban or rural area, taking steps to ensure your safety after dark is crucial. Here are some tips to help keep you safe. Stay Aware: Pay attention to your surroundings and be mindful of what\u2019s happening around you. Avoid distractions like texting or wearing headphones while walking in poorly lit areas. Walk briskly and with purpose. You are less likely to be targeted if you are not distracted. Use Well-Lit Paths: Stick to well-lit streets and pathways when walking or jogging at night. Avoid shortcuts through dark or deserted areas. Criminals prefer not to be seen. Travel in Groups: Whenever possible, travel with friends or in groups, as there is safety in numbers. Avoid walking alone late at night in unfamiliar or high-crime areas. You are less likely to be targeted in a group. Plan Your Route: Before heading out, let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return. Share your location with a trusted friend or family member and consider using apps that allow real-time location sharing. That way in the event something does happen your steps can more easily be traced. Carry Personal Safety Items: Items like a flashlight, personal alarm, or self-defense tool (like pepper spray) can provide added security. Make sure you\u2019re familiar with how to use these items safely and effectively. Stay Visible: Wear reflective clothing or accessories, especially if you are walking or jogging near traffic. This will help drivers see you more easily. Trust Your Instincts: If something doesn\u2019t feel right or if you feel unsafe, trust your gut and take action to protect yourself. Cross the street, go into a well-lit store, or call for help if necessary. Avoid Dark Areas : Avoid walking through and parking in areas that are poorly lit or deserted, especially if you are alone. Stick to busier, well-populated areas. These areas are less likely to be targeted. Use Public Transportation: If available, consider using public transportation or ridesharing services like Uber or Lyft instead of walking alone at night. Make sure to use the app\u2019s vehicle identifier to ensure you are in the right car. Know Emergency Contacts: Have emergency numbers programmed into your phone, such as local police, a trusted friend or family member, and a taxi service. In case of an emergency, you can quickly reach out for help. Stay Sober: Avoid excessive alcohol or substance use when you are out at night. Impaired judgement can make you vulnerable to dangerous situations. Lock Doors and Windows: At home, or in your car, make sure all doors and windows are securely locked. Consider installing motion-activated lights outside your residence. A well-lit home is less likely to be targeted. Security Systems: If possible, install a home security system or use security cameras to monitor your property. You can also invest in the Ring Doorbell for added protection. Community Watch Programs: Join or participate in local community watch programs if available. These programs can help deter criminal activity in your area. The holiday shopping season is upon us. Thieves, con artists, burglars, muggers, pickpockets and other people with bad intentions are out and about looking for their next victims. You have to be more conscious of your surroundings and be mindful of your belongings. If you\u2019re going shopping, make sure to follow these safety tips. Try to carry as little as possible: Try to leave your purse at home. Bring only the items you really need and keep them in your pocket. If you do bring a purse, hold it securely against your body. You can also wear it under a jacket or coat to keep it unexposed. Do not leave your purse in your shopping cart or on a counter, not even for a moment. Do not hang your purse on a stroller. Also, do not leave your belongings unattended on a table or chair beside you in a restaurant. Don\u2019t leave any purchases or your purse unattended while shopping or in a dressing room. Pay with checks or with credit cards when possible: Do not flash large amounts of cash. Try to bring only one credit card. Make sure you have the customer service number written down on a piece of paper or stored in your phone in the event that your purse is stolen. Keep your phone in your pocket and not in your purse while shopping.\u00a0 Consider making photocopies of all the important things in your purse or wallet and leave the copies in a secure place at home so if your belongings get stolen, you\u2019ll have records of all the important things. Never leave children unattended: If your child gets separated from you, teach them to find a cashier or security guard to help. If possible have them memorize your address and phone number. Teach them not to go with a stranger. Try not to shop alone: Shopping with someone else is safer and more fun. You are less likely to be a target if you are with someone else. Also, you can take turns using the dressing room and watching each other\u2019s belongings. Locate your keys before leaving the store: Looking for your keys distracts you and makes you an easy target for someone trying to commit a crime with minimal resistance. Being aware of your surroundings is one of the most important factors you need to consider while shopping. Take a good look at the faces and hands of people who might try to approach you. Most snatchers like to strike quickly without being recognized. Do not appear to be distracted or vulnerable. In the event an incident does occur, being vigilant will also help you better describe the assailant. Walk briskly and confidently. Try to shop during the day or stay in well-lit areas when possible. Muggers and thieves are more likely to strike in dark, secluded areas. Put your purchases in the trunk : Leaving your purchases visible in your vehicle can increase your risk of theft. To be safe, put as much as you can in the trunk. If some of your purchases have to go on your seats, consider covering them with a blanket. That way your car is less likely to become a target of criminals. Lock your car the moment you get inside before starting the car. Remember that safety precautions may vary depending on your location, so it\u2019s essential to be aware of the specific safety concerns in your area, and for your task, and adapt your actions accordingly.\u00a0 Staying informed and being prepared can significantly reduce the risk of encountering dangerous situations after dark.

Never leave children unattended: If your child gets separated from you, teach them to find a cashier or security guard to help. If possible have them memorize your address and phone number. Teach them not to go with a stranger. Try not to shop alone: Shopping with someone else is safer and more fun. You are less likely to be a target if you are with someone else. Also, you can take turns using the dressing room and watching each other\u2019s belongings. Locate your keys before leaving the store: Looking for your keys distracts you and makes you an easy target for someone trying to commit a crime with minimal resistance. Being aware of your surroundings is one of the most important factors you need to consider while shopping. Take a good look at the faces and hands of people who might try to approach you. Most snatchers like to strike quickly without being recognized. Do not appear to be distracted or vulnerable. In the event an incident does occur, being vigilant will also help you better describe the assailant. Walk briskly and confidently. Try to shop during the day or stay in well-lit areas when possible. Muggers and thieves are more likely to strike in dark, secluded areas. Put your purchases in the trunk : Leaving your purchases visible in your vehicle can increase your risk of theft. To be safe, put as much as you can in the trunk. If some of your purchases have to go on your seats, consider covering them with a blanket. That way your car is less likely to become a target of criminals. Lock your car the moment you get inside before starting the car. Remember that safety precautions may vary depending on your location, so it\u2019s essential to be aware of the specific safety concerns in your area, and for your task, and adapt your actions accordingly.\u00a0 Staying informed and being prepared can significantly reduce the risk of encountering dangerous situations after dark.

Personal safety is a weekly concern for a fifth of the workforce which means that up to either as they work or during their to and from their job every week. More people are feeling unsafe on a regular basis and this isn\u2019t down to specific workplaces or a particular type of work; it isn\u2019t even confined to times of work with people often fearful during unsociable hours. Every sector is reporting a concern for their safety. Many public-facing industries, such as . But they aren\u2019t alone in this. Logistics, production and manual trades all report high levels of feeling unsafe. What also stands out from the report conducted by Peoplesafe in to personal safety concerns is that, hybrid workers are the category of worker feeling the most unsafe, with nearly three-quarters reporting safety concerns. The reasons for this are varied and depend on the type of role but the main themes that unite them are: Travelling and commuting Varied locations for work (e.g. healthcare and travelling sales teams) Not having a safe space at home (e.g. increase in domestic violence related to this shift in working habits) Protecting your personal safety revolves around preventative thinking, taking sensible precautions and being aware of your surroundings. There are simple ways to improve your personal safety on a daily basis: most of which only require common sense or following good safety practices. Communication is essential for personal safety. Someone should always know where you\u2019re supposed to be and your planned movements. Setting up a \u2018buddy\u2019 system with a friend, colleague or family member will help to improve your personal safety because they can raise an alarm if you fail to check in with them. In addition, having a reliable method of communication available at all times will mean that you can get in touch with someone in the event of an emergency. Depending on the situation, you\u2019re likely to encounter different personal safety risks. We\u2019ve put together a range of personal safety tips based on a number of scenarios. Personal safety tips for everyday life There are certain things that you can remember to do regardless of the circumstances to protect your personal safety. These are all best practice tips to follow for everyday life. Stay alert \u2013 constantly be aware of your surroundings to prevent being caught off guard. Awareness is your best defence. Trust your instincts \u2013 if something doesn\u2019t feel right to you, trust your gut and take action by removing yourself from the situation (e.g. cross the road or don\u2019t go in to the property). It\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry. Don\u2019t be afraid to say no \u2013 if a stranger is asking for help with something and you feel as if something isn\u2019t right, politely tell them you can\u2019t help right now and keep moving. Store emergency contacts on your phone \u2013 save a list of trusted contacts in case the emergency services need to reach them after an incident. Keep your valuables hidden \u2013 make yourself less of a target by not advertising anything valuable from desirable technology to expensive-looking jewellery. Ensure that if you\u2019re carrying a bag that it\u2019s closed. Spread out your valuables \u2013 it\u2019s a good idea not to keep all your valuables in the same place. Use different spaces for your phone, keys and money. Carry cash \u2013 although majority of transactions are made via card or phone, having a small amount of cash is always sensible. Let someone know where you are going \u2013 when travelling alone, at least one person should be aware of where you are, where you\u2019re going and how long you expect it to take. Don\u2019t fight for your valuables \u2013 if you\u2019re unfortunate enough to be targeted by thieves, let your valuables go. They can be replaced, you can\u2019t. Scream for help \u2013 if someone attempts to grab you and they don\u2019t have a weapon, scream at the top of your lungs for help. Read our Carry a \u2013 either a dedicated device or app which can raise an alarm and summon an emergency response when you\u2019re in trouble. Personal safety while walking It\u2019s important to be mindful of your safety when walking, especially if you\u2019re alone and it\u2019s late or dark, making you more vulnerable compared to people travelling in groups. Try not to walk alone \u2013 wherever possible walk with a friend, colleague or someone you know. Choose appropriate footwear \u2013 wear sensible shoes (such as trainers or anything flat) that will allow for you to make a quick getaway. Be alert to your surroundings \u2013 concentrate on where you\u2019re going and what\u2019s happening around you. Don\u2019t be distracted by your phone or have headphones in both ears so that you can\u2019t hear potential danger signs. Walk with confidence and purpose \u2013 keep your head up and walk with a steady pace. Travel as if you know where you\u2019re going even if you don\u2019t. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to make eye contact with people you pass. Stick to public areas \u2013 avoid cutting through parks, fields, alleyways, woods or other shortcuts. Shaving off time from your journey isn\u2019t worth the risk. Walk in the direction of oncoming traffic \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to see any accidents happening up ahead and it will prevent vehicles from pulling up behind you. Don\u2019t go home if you think you\u2019re being followed \u2013 instead, go somewhere public where you can alert security or to a friend or family members\u2019 house. Personal safety while driving Even when you\u2019ve got the protection of a vehicle, there are still things that you can do to protect your personal safety: Always have enough fuel \u2013 try to keep at least a quarter of a tank (or charge if you have an electric car). Store a charging cable or powerbank \u2013 if your phone or any other device needs charging while you\u2019re out, you can use your vehicle to give it some extra battery life. Remember to charge your powerbank regularly so that you don\u2019t lose your back up power source. Park sensibly \u2013 try to find well-lit areas and somewhere you won\u2019t get blocked in. If possible, park where you can still see your vehicle. Reverse into bays \u2013 you\u2019re then facing the right way if you need to leave quickly. Lock the doors \u2013 check that the doors are locked before leaving the vehicle. Have your car keys ready \u2013 before you get to your vehicle, have your keys in your hand so you don\u2019t have to linger outside. Check the back seat \u2013 before getting in and driving off, check to make sure no one is stowed away in the back. Drive somewhere public if you think you\u2019re being followed \u2013 preferably somewhere with security such as a police station or even a supermarket. If your car breaks down remain in your vehicle \u2013 if the conditions are safe keep the doors locked and your hazard warning lights on until help arrives. If you have a mobile phone, ring a friend or family member to tell them what has happened and where you are. Personal safety while travelling There are a number of personal safety concerns to be aware of when you\u2019re making a journey by using public transport or soliciting a taxi. Public transport Plan your route \u2013 know where you\u2019re going, how to get there and which stop(s) you need. Check the last departure time \u2013 plan how you\u2019re getting home and look ahead for the last train, tube or bus to your destination. Wait in a well-lit area \u2013 try and stand near other people and not look isolated. Have your ticket, pass or payment method ready \u2013 this helps to keep your purse or wallet out of sight while you\u2019re waiting to board. Sit with other people \u2013 particularly when it\u2019s dark, try to avoid empty train carriages or the top level of double decker buses. Sitting near the bus driver or train guard should make you feel safer. Move if you feel uncomfortable \u2013 if you are sat somewhere and feel uneasy move away if you can. On a train you could exit at the next stop and find another carriage where you feel safer or you can alert a member of staff at the station if you feel someone needs to intervene. Know your exits and alarms \u2013 when on any form of public transport, check where the nearest exits and alarms are in case you need to get off for whatever reason. Get off if you feel unsafe \u2013 if you no longer want to be on the bus, train or tube, get off at the next stop even if it\u2019s not your destination. You can always board the next one or contact a taxi service to take you the rest of the way. Arrange for someone to meet you \u2013 if you feel unsafe, try and get someone to meet you at the bus stop or train station. Report any incidents \u2013 the non-emergency text number for British Transport Police is 61016 or you can call the police on 101. Taxis Use a valid taxi service \u2013 check that the cab is before getting in it. You can also ask the driver to show you their badge before starting the journey. Pre-book \u2013 try to avoid using private-hire cars that tout for business. Instead, use a trusted local firm and book your journey in advance. Share information with someone you trust \u2013 let someone know about the vehicle you\u2019re in and the journey you\u2019re taking. Check it\u2019s your taxi \u2013 ask the driver to confirm who they are picking up and where they\u2019re going. Sit behind the driver \u2013 make yourself as inaccessible as possible. Personal safety at home Home should be a place where everyone feels safe. Personal safety at home is something that can easily be prioritised, but often gets taken for granted. Look at your home through the eyes of a burglar \u2013 half of burglaries are opportunistic by taking advantage of an open window or unlocked door. Instal motion sensor lights \u2013 they will act as a deterrent and provide a visual alert that someone is at your home. Leave keys in a sensible place \u2013 don\u2019t put them near the front door or anywhere that they can be seen from outside. Avoid attaching your name and address to your keys \u2013 if they were lost or stolen, it would make it easy for a burglar. Check the ID of house callers \u2013 if you\u2019re unconvinced by the ID, call the organisation using the number from the internet, or paperwork if you have it, to check that the visit is genuine. Don\u2019t go inside if you suspect there\u2019s an intruder in your home \u2013 call the police who have the training to deal with the incident. Personal safety while lone working If you work alone, your employer has a general to provide you with a safe workplace or make provisions to keep you safe at work. Similarly, lone workers have a responsibility to take reasonable care of their own personal safety. The risks of lone working typically arise from the people you will interact with; the environment you\u2019re working in; or the task you\u2019re undertaking. Whenever you\u2019re working alone, always make sure that a colleague knows where you\u2019re going to be, who you\u2019re going to meet and when you\u2019re supposed to finish. We\u2019ve put together some personal safety tips for lone workers in different situations. Working in other people\u2019s homes or premises Familiarise yourself with the area \u2013 Google Street View can help you see the location before you arrive. Once there, check your mobile phone reception and follow any lone working procedures (e.g. check in with your buddy) set out in the company\u2019s . Have an exit strategy before you arrive \u2013 thinking about these in advance will help you to recall them in a time of stress. Park as nearby as possible \u2013 limit the distance you have to complete, especially in the dark. Only bring what is essential \u2013 don\u2019t weigh yourself down with unnecessary items that will make you less mobile and could make you more of a target. Wear appropriate clothing \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a specific uniform, wear clothes that you can easily move around in. Keep a clear path to the door \u2013 avoid positioning yourself so that you become trapped. If possible, be the closest person to the door. Conduct a dynamic risk assessment \u2013 observe your surroundings. Note the exits, how the door opens (e.g. push or pull), plus look for any dangers, such as dogs. Working alone from a fixed base Instal an intercom or buzzer system \u2013 this will provide a barrier between the lone worker and the person trying to gain entry. It also gives the lone worker the opportunity to qualify the visitor. Keep cash out of sight \u2013 if you need to cash up at the end of the day, complete this task as far away from the front door as possible, preferably in a room that locks. Consider a \u2018safe haven\u2019 \u2013 having a room that locks where you can retreat to if necessary. Ensure there is a working phone in this room. Be aware of escape routes \u2013 in case of emergency, it\u2019s important to know how to leave the building safely. Working alone from home Avoid trailing leads and cables \u2013 keep your work area tidy and arrange equipment and furniture to minimise slip and trip risks. Check electrical equipment is in good condition \u2013 including plugs, leads, wires and cables. Regularly check-in with colleagues \u2013 implement a system where someone would raise an alarm if no one in the business had heard from you in a certain amount of time. Consider conducting client meetings at a neutral venue \u2013 you might be able to rent a meeting space for relatively low cost. Give the impression other people are home \u2013 have the radio or tv on in another room to make it seem as though you\u2019re not alone. Depersonalise your meeting room \u2013 if you have to have clients in your home, conduct the meeting in a room with minimal personal information on display. Working in rural areas Have a GPS device \u2013 these rely on satellites to find your position and work better in more isolated locations. Mobile phones may not work in certain areas. We have two satellite personal safety devices available: and . If you are working in rural locations, we have more in-depth Improve personal safety with a personal safety alarm Personal safety alarms or are available in the form of , or can be activated on your smartphone by downloading a specialist . The benefits of having a personal safety alarm go far beyond the security felt simply by carrying one. Connected to a 24/7 , alarms can be activated at any time of day and be answered by an expert call handler who is trained to deal with emergency situations. If you are given a personal safety alarm for work, remember that you can use the device outside of working hours, especially when making journeys alone and in the dark. As part of the accreditation process, all Peoplesafe solutions have built-in GPS capabilities that we have enhanced with What3Words technology so we can pinpoint your location to within 5m\u00b2 when you raise an alarm. For more information about how we can help to protect your personal safety, . Practising these personal safety habits is likely to reduce your stress levels. Situations that pose personal safety risks are typically stressful, for example, walking through a field alone in the dark with no one else in sight to help. Focusing on personal safety shouldn\u2019t stop you from doing things you enjoy or living a normal life; it\u2019s about taking the appropriate steps to stay safe. Adopting good personal safety habits means that you act on the safety hazards you have the power to control and influence.

Trust your instincts \u2013 if something doesn\u2019t feel right to you, trust your gut and take action by removing yourself from the situation (e.g. cross the road or don\u2019t go in to the property). It\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry. Don\u2019t be afraid to say no \u2013 if a stranger is asking for help with something and you feel as if something isn\u2019t right, politely tell them you can\u2019t help right now and keep moving. Store emergency contacts on your phone \u2013 save a list of trusted contacts in case the emergency services need to reach them after an incident. Keep your valuables hidden \u2013 make yourself less of a target by not advertising anything valuable from desirable technology to expensive-looking jewellery. Ensure that if you\u2019re carrying a bag that it\u2019s closed. Spread out your valuables \u2013 it\u2019s a good idea not to keep all your valuables in the same place. Use different spaces for your phone, keys and money. Carry cash \u2013 although majority of transactions are made via card or phone, having a small amount of cash is always sensible. Let someone know where you are going \u2013 when travelling alone, at least one person should be aware of where you are, where you\u2019re going and how long you expect it to take. Don\u2019t fight for your valuables \u2013 if you\u2019re unfortunate enough to be targeted by thieves, let your valuables go. They can be replaced, you can\u2019t. Scream for help \u2013 if someone attempts to grab you and they don\u2019t have a weapon, scream at the top of your lungs for help. Read our Carry a \u2013 either a dedicated device or app which can raise an alarm and summon an emergency response when you\u2019re in trouble. Personal safety while walking It\u2019s important to be mindful of your safety when walking, especially if you\u2019re alone and it\u2019s late or dark, making you more vulnerable compared to people travelling in groups. Try not to walk alone \u2013 wherever possible walk with a friend, colleague or someone you know. Choose appropriate footwear \u2013 wear sensible shoes (such as trainers or anything flat) that will allow for you to make a quick getaway. Be alert to your surroundings \u2013 concentrate on where you\u2019re going and what\u2019s happening around you. Don\u2019t be distracted by your phone or have headphones in both ears so that you can\u2019t hear potential danger signs. Walk with confidence and purpose \u2013 keep your head up and walk with a steady pace. Travel as if you know where you\u2019re going even if you don\u2019t. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to make eye contact with people you pass. Stick to public areas \u2013 avoid cutting through parks, fields, alleyways, woods or other shortcuts. Shaving off time from your journey isn\u2019t worth the risk. Walk in the direction of oncoming traffic \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to see any accidents happening up ahead and it will prevent vehicles from pulling up behind you. Don\u2019t go home if you think you\u2019re being followed \u2013 instead, go somewhere public where you can alert security or to a friend or family members\u2019 house. Personal safety while driving Even when you\u2019ve got the protection of a vehicle, there are still things that you can do to protect your personal safety: Always have enough fuel \u2013 try to keep at least a quarter of a tank (or charge if you have an electric car). Store a charging cable or powerbank \u2013 if your phone or any other device needs charging while you\u2019re out, you can use your vehicle to give it some extra battery life. Remember to charge your powerbank regularly so that you don\u2019t lose your back up power source. Park sensibly \u2013 try to find well-lit areas and somewhere you won\u2019t get blocked in. If possible, park where you can still see your vehicle. Reverse into bays \u2013 you\u2019re then facing the right way if you need to leave quickly. Lock the doors \u2013 check that the doors are locked before leaving the vehicle. Have your car keys ready \u2013 before you get to your vehicle, have your keys in your hand so you don\u2019t have to linger outside. Check the back seat \u2013 before getting in and driving off, check to make sure no one is stowed away in the back. Drive somewhere public if you think you\u2019re being followed \u2013 preferably somewhere with security such as a police station or even a supermarket. If your car breaks down remain in your vehicle \u2013 if the conditions are safe keep the doors locked and your hazard warning lights on until help arrives. If you have a mobile phone, ring a friend or family member to tell them what has happened and where you are. Personal safety while travelling There are a number of personal safety concerns to be aware of when you\u2019re making a journey by using public transport or soliciting a taxi. Public transport Plan your route \u2013 know where you\u2019re going, how to get there and which stop(s) you need. Check the last departure time \u2013 plan how you\u2019re getting home and look ahead for the last train, tube or bus to your destination. Wait in a well-lit area \u2013 try and stand near other people and not look isolated. Have your ticket, pass or payment method ready \u2013 this helps to keep your purse or wallet out of sight while you\u2019re waiting to board. Sit with other people \u2013 particularly when it\u2019s dark, try to avoid empty train carriages or the top level of double decker buses. Sitting near the bus driver or train guard should make you feel safer. Move if you feel uncomfortable \u2013 if you are sat somewhere and feel uneasy move away if you can. On a train you could exit at the next stop and find another carriage where you feel safer or you can alert a member of staff at the station if you feel someone needs to intervene. Know your exits and alarms \u2013 when on any form of public transport, check where the nearest exits and alarms are in case you need to get off for whatever reason. Get off if you feel unsafe \u2013 if you no longer want to be on the bus, train or tube, get off at the next stop even if it\u2019s not your destination. You can always board the next one or contact a taxi service to take you the rest of the way. Arrange for someone to meet you \u2013 if you feel unsafe, try and get someone to meet you at the bus stop or train station. Report any incidents \u2013 the non-emergency text number for British Transport Police is 61016 or you can call the police on 101. Taxis Use a valid taxi service \u2013 check that the cab is before getting in it. You can also ask the driver to show you their badge before starting the journey. Pre-book \u2013 try to avoid using private-hire cars that tout for business. Instead, use a trusted local firm and book your journey in advance. Share information with someone you trust \u2013 let someone know about the vehicle you\u2019re in and the journey you\u2019re taking. Check it\u2019s your taxi \u2013 ask the driver to confirm who they are picking up and where they\u2019re going. Sit behind the driver \u2013 make yourself as inaccessible as possible. Personal safety at home Home should be a place where everyone feels safe. Personal safety at home is something that can easily be prioritised, but often gets taken for granted. Look at your home through the eyes of a burglar \u2013 half of burglaries are opportunistic by taking advantage of an open window or unlocked door. Instal motion sensor lights \u2013 they will act as a deterrent and provide a visual alert that someone is at your home. Leave keys in a sensible place \u2013 don\u2019t put them near the front door or anywhere that they can be seen from outside. Avoid attaching your name and address to your keys \u2013 if they were lost or stolen, it would make it easy for a burglar. Check the ID of house callers \u2013 if you\u2019re unconvinced by the ID, call the organisation using the number from the internet, or paperwork if you have it, to check that the visit is genuine. Don\u2019t go inside if you suspect there\u2019s an intruder in your home \u2013 call the police who have the training to deal with the incident. Personal safety while lone working If you work alone, your employer has a general to provide you with a safe workplace or make provisions to keep you safe at work. Similarly, lone workers have a responsibility to take reasonable care of their own personal safety. The risks of lone working typically arise from the people you will interact with; the environment you\u2019re working in; or the task you\u2019re undertaking. Whenever you\u2019re working alone, always make sure that a colleague knows where you\u2019re going to be, who you\u2019re going to meet and when you\u2019re supposed to finish. We\u2019ve put together some personal safety tips for lone workers in different situations. Working in other people\u2019s homes or premises Familiarise yourself with the area \u2013 Google Street View can help you see the location before you arrive. Once there, check your mobile phone reception and follow any lone working procedures (e.g. check in with your buddy) set out in the company\u2019s . Have an exit strategy before you arrive \u2013 thinking about these in advance will help you to recall them in a time of stress. Park as nearby as possible \u2013 limit the distance you have to complete, especially in the dark. Only bring what is essential \u2013 don\u2019t weigh yourself down with unnecessary items that will make you less mobile and could make you more of a target. Wear appropriate clothing \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a specific uniform, wear clothes that you can easily move around in. Keep a clear path to the door \u2013 avoid positioning yourself so that you become trapped. If possible, be the closest person to the door. Conduct a dynamic risk assessment \u2013 observe your surroundings. Note the exits, how the door opens (e.g. push or pull), plus look for any dangers, such as dogs. Working alone from a fixed base Instal an intercom or buzzer system \u2013 this will provide a barrier between the lone worker and the person trying to gain entry. It also gives the lone worker the opportunity to qualify the visitor. Keep cash out of sight \u2013 if you need to cash up at the end of the day, complete this task as far away from the front door as possible, preferably in a room that locks. Consider a \u2018safe haven\u2019 \u2013 having a room that locks where you can retreat to if necessary. Ensure there is a working phone in this room. Be aware of escape routes \u2013 in case of emergency, it\u2019s important to know how to leave the building safely. Working alone from home Avoid trailing leads and cables \u2013 keep your work area tidy and arrange equipment and furniture to minimise slip and trip risks. Check electrical equipment is in good condition \u2013 including plugs, leads, wires and cables. Regularly check-in with colleagues \u2013 implement a system where someone would raise an alarm if no one in the business had heard from you in a certain amount of time. Consider conducting client meetings at a neutral venue \u2013 you might be able to rent a meeting space for relatively low cost. Give the impression other people are home \u2013 have the radio or tv on in another room to make it seem as though you\u2019re not alone. Depersonalise your meeting room \u2013 if you have to have clients in your home, conduct the meeting in a room with minimal personal information on display. Working in rural areas Have a GPS device \u2013 these rely on satellites to find your position and work better in more isolated locations. Mobile phones may not work in certain areas. We have two satellite personal safety devices available: and . If you are working in rural locations, we have more in-depth Improve personal safety with a personal safety alarm Personal safety alarms or are available in the form of , or can be activated on your smartphone by downloading a specialist . The benefits of having a personal safety alarm go far beyond the security felt simply by carrying one. Connected to a 24/7 , alarms can be activated at any time of day and be answered by an expert call handler who is trained to deal with emergency situations. If you are given a personal safety alarm for work, remember that you can use the device outside of working hours, especially when making journeys alone and in the dark. As part of the accreditation process, all Peoplesafe solutions have built-in GPS capabilities that we have enhanced with What3Words technology so we can pinpoint your location to within 5m\u00b2 when you raise an alarm. For more information about how we can help to protect your personal safety, . Practising these personal safety habits is likely to reduce your stress levels. Situations that pose personal safety risks are typically stressful, for example, walking through a field alone in the dark with no one else in sight to help. Focusing on personal safety shouldn\u2019t stop you from doing things you enjoy or living a normal life; it\u2019s about taking the appropriate steps to stay safe. Adopting good personal safety habits means that you act on the safety hazards you have the power to control and influence.

Always be alert and aware of the people around you. Educate yourself concerning prevention tactics. Be aware of locations and situations which would make you appear vulnerable to crime, such as alleys and dark parking lots. Street Precautions Be alert to your surroundings and the people around you\u2014especially if you are alone or it is dark. Whenever possible, travel with a friend. Stay in well-lighted areas as much as possible. Walk close to the curb. Avoid doorways, bushes and alleys where someone could hide. Walk confidently at a steady pace. Make eye contact with people when walking. Do not respond to conversation from strangers on the street\u2014continue walking. If you carry a purse, carry it securely between your arm and your body. Although a purse-snatcher's intent is to steal the purse, your personal safety may depend on not clinging to it. Do not use or wear anything that will impede your vision or hearing (i.e. iPods). Car Safety Always lock your car doors after entering or leaving your vehicle. Park in well-lighted areas. Have your car keys in your hand so you don't have to linger before entering your car. Check the interior of your vehicle for intruders before entering your car. If you think you are being followed, drive to a public place or a police or sheriff station. If your car breaks down, open the hood and attach a white cloth to the car antennae. If someone stops to help, stay in your locked car and ask them to call the police, sheriff or a tow truck service. Don't stop to aid motorists by the side of the road. Make a phone call requesting help for them. While Waiting for a Bus Be alert to your surroundings and the people around you. Try to avoid isolated bus stops. Don't open your purse or wallet while boarding the bus\u2014have your pass or money already in your hand. Keep jewelry out of sight; don't flash jewelry; turn rings around so the stones don't show. On Board Buses During off hours, ride as near to the bus operator as possible If someone bothers you or makes you feel uncomfortable, change seats. Inform the driver of the situation. Carry your wallet inside your coat, or in a front pocket. Keep your belongings in front of you and hold close to your body with both hands. Be alert to pickpocketers on crowded buses; check your purse or wallet if someone is jostling, crowding or pushing you. Office Security Never leave your purse or wallet in plain view or in common accessible areas. Don't leave cash or valuables at the office. If you work alone or after business hours, keep the office door locked. If you work late, try to find another worker or a security guard to walk out with you. In an elevator, be mindful that there is a distress alarm on the control panel. Be alert for pickpocketers on crowded elevators. Report all suspicious persons and activities to the proper authorities (office manager, building security, law enforcement). Be aware of escape routes for emergencies and post the police and fire department numbers near telephones. Finally, if a crime does occur...REPORT IT! Everyone should consider it his or her responsibility to report crime. Many criminals develop favorite areas for committing crime, as well as predictable methods of operation. When you report all the facts about a crime, it helps the police assign officers in the places where crimes are occurring or where they are most likely to occur, and your report may help prevent a crime from reoccurring. At least half of the crimes in the Unites States go unreported, either because people don't think the police can do anything about it, or because people don't want to get involved. If you don't report a crime, this allows the criminal to continue to operate without interference. In many cases, it is the information provided by victims and witnesses that leads to the arrest of a criminal. So tell the police as much as you can; no fact is too trivial. The police need the eyes and ears of all citizens.

When used effectively and coupled with a confidant attitude and keen awareness, you can avoid dangerous confrontations with potential assailants, decreasing your chances of becoming a victim. Make it a habit to protect yourself from harm by using common sense, security devices and a few safety practices. But remember, even the most expensive security devices will not keep you safe if you do not use them. The following tips are guides to follow to protect yourself in public spaces: Protecting Yourself Stay Alert: Be conscious of what, or who, is around you.

Trust Your Instincts: Use your intuition. If something does not feel right, remove yourself from the situation immediately. Know the Neighborhood: Use well-traveled routes and be cautious of strangers in the area. On Foot Don't Take Short Cuts: Stick to well-lit, well-traveled streets, especially if you are in an unfamiliar area. Don't Walk Alone: Walk with spouse, friend or group. Don't Flash Cash: Keep money hidden; carry your purse close to your body. Automated Teller Machines: Avoid using at night where lighting and visibility to others is poor. Be cautious of other persons approaching you at the ATM. Be Prepared: Wear comfortable clothing when walking and always have an escape plan.

        "markdown": "Personal Safety Tips Incidents of violence can occur anywhere at anytime. Trust your gut feeling that something may be wrong. These are some guidelines that may help reduce potential vulnerability. Remember though, whether you choose to use the options or not, no one has the right to harm you. At Home \u2022 Be aware of your surroundings. Be familiar with who is coming and going - who belongs and who doesn't. Know your neighbors and learn who can be called for assistance when needed. Women may be safer using only first initials and last names on mailboxes and in phone directories. Change locks when you move into a new residence. Make sure your doors have deadbolt locks, security chains and peepholes. Use them! \u2022 Don't hide spare keys outdoors. \u2022 Check identification of repair people, salespeople, meter readers, etc., come to the door. Don't hesitate to call and check them out or refuse them admittance if something feels wrong. If you let someone in and have second thoughts, be assertive. Tell them to leave or leave yourself. Pretend you are not alone by mentioning a friend or family member asleep in the next room. \u2022 Make sure entrances, garages, grounds and hallways are well-lighted. Leave porch lights on at night or when you expect to return after dark. Consider using dusk to dawn lighting. Leave an interior light on in a room or two with the shades drawn. Leave a radio or TV on. Instruct children and baby-sitters not to give out information about who is home, who is out or for how long. Don't leave notes on your door for others or allow solicitor's material to remain on your doorsteps since they advertise your absence. If you suspect your home has been broken into, don't go in \u2013 use your cell phone, go to a neighbors or someplace else and call the police. Always lock doors when doing yard work or otherwise spending time in the yard. If you have a cell phone, take it outside with you. Be careful when using computer internet or online services. Use caution in providing personal information. Being flooded with e-mail can be annoying; having a chat room participant show up at your door uninvited can be terrifying. In Your Car \u2022 Keep car doors locked at all times, and windows rolled up all the way. \u2022 If you have car trouble, raise the hood and stay in your vehicle. If someone offers assistance, roll the window down just enough to talk to them. Ask them to call the police for you if you do not have a cell phone with you.

If you carry a handbag, hold it close to your body with fastener closed and turned toward your body so a thief can't grab it and cause injury or knock you down. \"Fanny-packs\" keep your personal items close to you while keeping your hands free. Don't wear headphones. They block your ability to hear someone approach you. If you must wear one, use only one ear bud. Again, trust your instincts.

        "html": "Personal Safety Tips Incidents of violence can occur anywhere at anytime. Trust your gut feeling that something may be wrong. These are some guidelines that may help reduce potential vulnerability. Remember though, whether you choose to use the options or not, no one has the right to harm you. At Home \u2022 Be aware of your surroundings. Be familiar with who is coming and going - who belongs and who doesn't. Know your neighbors and learn who can be called for assistance when needed. Women may be safer using only first initials and last names on mailboxes and in phone directories. Change locks when you move into a new residence. Make sure your doors have deadbolt locks, security chains and peepholes. Use them! \u2022 Don't hide spare keys outdoors. \u2022 Check identification of repair people, salespeople, meter readers, etc., come to the door. Don't hesitate to call and check them out or refuse them admittance if something feels wrong. If you let someone in and have second thoughts, be assertive. Tell them to leave or leave yourself.  Pretend you are not alone by mentioning a friend or family member asleep in the next room. \u2022 Make sure entrances, garages, grounds and hallways are well-lighted. Leave porch lights on at night or when you expect to return after dark. Consider using dusk to dawn lighting.  Leave an interior light on in a room or two with the shades drawn. Leave a radio or TV on. Instruct children and baby-sitters not to give out information about who is home, who is out or for how long. Don't leave notes on your door for others or allow solicitor's material to remain on your doorsteps since they advertise your absence. If you suspect your home has been broken into, don't go in \u2013 use your cell phone, go to a neighbors or someplace else and call the police. Always lock doors when doing yard work or otherwise spending time in the yard. If you have a cell phone, take it outside with you. Be careful when using computer internet or online services. Use caution in providing personal information. Being flooded with e-mail can be annoying; having a chat room participant show up at your door uninvited can be terrifying. In Your Car \u2022 Keep car doors locked at all times, and windows rolled up all the way. \u2022 If you have car trouble, raise the hood and stay in your vehicle. If someone offers assistance, roll the window down just enough to talk to them. Ask them to call the police for you if you do not have a cell phone with you. Keep your cell phone charged at all times and keep a charger in your vehicle. \u2022 Even cell phones that have no service can be used to call 911 providing they are charged.

Pay attention to the make, model, and color of the car as well as the driver\u2019s name and photo. Make sure to match the license plate number on your screen to the one you see in real life. Map Your Own Route During the Ride This is especially important if you\u2019re in a different city and aren\u2019t familiar with the route.

Leave a house key with a trusted neighbor in case of emergency. Lock all windows and doors before you go. Make a record of your passport, credit card and traveler's check numbers, as well as plane, train, or bus tickets. Give a copy of the list to a family member or friend for safekeeping. On the Road Carry as little cash as possible. Use traveler's checks, ATM cards, credit cards, or electronic payment on your phone whenever possible. Keep careful tabs on your plane, train or bus tickets; they are as good as cash. If you're driving, plan your route carefully. Travel on main roads and use maps. Have your car serviced before you leave. If you're stopping overnight, remove luggage and other valuables from the car.

In the Hotel Don't leave your luggage unattended anywhere. Use all auxiliary locking devices when occupying or leaving your room. Do not leave valuables in your vehicle or hotel room. Place them in the hotel safe deposit box. Always take cash, credit cards and keys with you. Identify fire exits, elevators, and public phones in case of need.

If a person claims to be an employee, call the front desk and ask if someone from the staff is supposed to have access to your room, and why. In Your New Environment Carry your purse close to your body; don't let it dangle. Carry your wallet in an inside coat or front trouser pocket. Learn about your surroundings. Ask the hotel/motel clerk about problem areas and avoid them. Select sightseeing companies and guides carefully.

Help Reduce the Likelihood of Being Robbed Lock unused doors. Avoid working alone. If that is not possible, turn on a hidden radio or television so criminals will think someone else is there with you. Vary the schedules and route for your bank deposits each day. Only keep necessary cash in the register. Make sure the cash register is clearly visible to passersby.\u00a0 Arrange the counter so that the customer (or, the robber) is visible from the street. Avoid placing signs or displays near windows that block visibility into the business from the street. Use a drop safe to deposit excess cash. Display signs at entrances and exits indicating that safes require secondary keys not in possession of employees. Advertise your security alarm system with signs in visible locations. Work with other stores on your block and agree to collectively watch for any suspicious behavior. Promptly report suspicious behavior to the police.\u00a0 In Palo Alto, call our 24-hour dispatch center at or call if it's an emergency. What to Do During a Robbery Do what the robber demands.\u00a0 Stay calm and do not resist. If your business is equipped with a silent alarm and you can reach it without being noticed, use it.\u00a0 Otherwise, wait until the robber leaves and then activate the alarm and also call to report the robbery as quickly as possible. If possible, signal other employees that a robbery is in progress.\u00a0 Have a prearranged signal for such emergencies.\u00a0 If the robber may see you, though, wait. Try to avoid sudden moves.\u00a0 Many robbers are just as nervous as their victims. The most important thing you do if you are robbed is be the best possible observer / witness you can be.\u00a0 Focus on paying attention to as many details on the robber as possible:\u00a0 not only their appearance and clothing, but also any accents, the words they use, and anything else that may be helpful for the police investigation. After the Robbery Call immediately.\u00a0 Stay on the phone and answer all of the dispatcher's questions. Lock the doors to the business to prevent other customers from coming into the crime scene, and to prevent possible re-entry by the suspect. Write down everything you can remember about the robber and the crime itself:\u00a0appearance, height, weight, color of hair and eyes, scars, tattoos, accent, clothing, weapon, and anything unusual about them. Try to remember the robber's exact words. Try to observe the vehicle the robber uses to get away, if you can do so safely from inside your business. Keep everyone away from any surfaces the robber may have touched.\u00a0 Police will be interested in collecting physical evidence like fingerprints and DNA. Cooperate fully with the police during the investigation, and with the prosecutors if a suspect is ultimately arrested and charged.\u00a0 Your ongoing help in the criminal justice system is crucial.

Leave a house key with a trusted neighbor in case of emergency. Lock all windows and doors before you go. Make a record of your passport, credit card and traveler's check numbers, as well as plane, train, or bus tickets. Give a copy of the list to a family member or friend for safekeeping. On the Road Carry as little cash as possible. Use traveler's checks, ATM cards, credit cards, or electronic payment on your phone whenever possible.

Place them in the hotel safe deposit box. Always take cash, credit cards and keys with you. Identify fire exits, elevators, and public phones in case of need.

Leave the TV on in your room when you are gone to make it seem occupied. Be observant. Report any suspicious activity to management and/or the local police as appropriate. Look around before entering parking lots or garages. Park near well-lit walkways when possible. Do not answer the door in a hotel or motel room without verifying who it is. If a person claims to be an employee, call the front desk and ask if someone from the staff is supposed to have access to your room, and why. In Your New Environment Carry your purse close to your body; don't let it dangle. Carry your wallet in an inside coat or front trouser pocket. Learn about your surroundings. Ask the hotel/motel clerk about problem areas and avoid them. Select sightseeing companies and guides carefully. Make sure everyone in your party, including children, knows the name, address, and telephone number of your hotel or motel.\u00a0 Consider programming it into everyone's digital device. Avoid advertising that you are a tourist by the way you dress. Carry only the cash that you need, and in small denominations. Don't flash your cash or jewelry. If members of your group go off separately, be sure to check in at prearranged times or otherwise make arrangements to stay in touch. Keeping Fit (Safely) While on the Road There is no reason to cancel your daily fitness routine just because you are traveling.\u00a0 Just take some precautions: When jogging or walking, team up with a friend, colleague, or family member, especially if you go out early in the morning or late at night.

Only keep necessary cash in the register. Make sure the cash register is clearly visible to passersby.\u00a0 Arrange the counter so that the customer (or, the robber) is visible from the street. Avoid placing signs or displays near windows that block visibility into the business from the street. Use a drop safe to deposit excess cash. Display signs at entrances and exits indicating that safes require secondary keys not in possession of employees. Advertise your security alarm system with signs in visible locations. Work with other stores on your block and agree to collectively watch for any suspicious behavior. Promptly report suspicious behavior to the police.\u00a0 In Palo Alto, call our 24-hour dispatch center at or call if it's an emergency. What to Do During a Robbery Do what the robber demands.\u00a0 Stay calm and do not resist.

If possible, signal other employees that a robbery is in progress.\u00a0 Have a prearranged signal for such emergencies.\u00a0 If the robber may see you, though, wait. Try to avoid sudden moves.\u00a0 Many robbers are just as nervous as their victims. The most important thing you do if you are robbed is be the best possible observer / witness you can be.\u00a0 Focus on paying attention to as many details on the robber as possible:\u00a0 not only their appearance and clothing, but also any accents, the words they use, and anything else that may be helpful for the police investigation. After the Robbery Call immediately.\u00a0 Stay on the phone and answer all of the dispatcher's questions. Lock the doors to the business to prevent other customers from coming into the crime scene, and to prevent possible re-entry by the suspect. Write down everything you can remember about the robber and the crime itself:\u00a0appearance, height, weight, color of hair and eyes, scars, tattoos, accent, clothing, weapon, and anything unusual about them. Try to remember the robber's exact words. Try to observe the vehicle the robber uses to get away, if you can do so safely from inside your business. Keep everyone away from any surfaces the robber may have touched.\u00a0 Police will be interested in collecting physical evidence like fingerprints and DNA. Cooperate fully with the police during the investigation, and with the prosecutors if a suspect is ultimately arrested and charged.\u00a0 Your ongoing help in the criminal justice system is crucial.

        "markdown": "Travel Safety when Using Public Transport Introduction Public transport is the mode of transport for most South Africans as well as the\u00a0means of travel for many of our foreign visitors.\u00a0Whether it is minibus taxis, trains, passenger buses, or aeroplanes, we need to recognize the importance of safety awareness when travelling with\u00a0these vehicles. Not only do we need to pay close attention to general safety rules, but also be attentive to averting the dangers of criminal activity such as theft, intimidation or gender-based violence. In this section [while focusing mostly on road transport]\u00a0we would like to consider some of the rights and obligations of both transport operators and commuters, while also offering some suggestions for safe travel! What are the basic rights of commuters? Public transport passengers have the right to: Freedom to choose the public transport mode or vehicle from those available that they would like to use, where this choice affects their safety. Safe public transport services and roadworthy vehicles. Drivers with a valid license and professional driving permits. Reliable services that transport them according to schedule or expectation. Travel on vehicles that are not overloaded or overcrowded. Professional and courteous treatment from the drivers and staff of all public transport operators. Travel on a public transport service without experiencing any form of harassment or discrimination. Transport services that provide value for money. What should be expected from Public Transport Operators and their Passengers? Transport operators at all levels should maximise efforts to improve safety. Good road behaviour should include stopping at traffic signs, safe speed, safer following distance and not driving under the influence of alcohol. Taxi operators and bus operators must respect the rights of the passengers they transport from one place to another and commuters should be treated as contributors to social and economic development. Operators must ensure that their vehicles are driven by drivers who are medically fit to drive public passengers and are always in possession of valid professional driving permits. Drivers MUST pay attention to passenger safety, rights and respect passengers. Drivers must listen carefully to passenger complaints, identify problem areas and if appropriate take action to remedy the situation. It is also the responsibility of operators to prohibit drivers from harassing, intimidating or molesting passengers and to act against drivers who do so. Passengers have the responsibility to make sure that vehicles stop before boarding or alighting, pay the valid fare for the trip and show tickets for inspection when required. Commuters have the right to ask the driver not to exceed the number of passengers permitted to be carried in the vehicle or board a vehicle, which is overloaded. Rules of the Road and Guidance from Public Transport Operators Always Obey the Rules of the Road Refrain from any criminal activity or carrying any illegal items in your baggage. If the vehicle is fitted with seatbelts - Wear them! Do not hang outside a train or let any part of your body protrude beyond the public transport vehicle. Obey the Safety Guidance and Regulations from the Operator - If prohibited from consuming food and liquor during the trip - Obey! Be focused on good hygiene for your safety and the safety of fellow commuters. It is important to share some sound advice from the Automobile Association after the outbreak of the Coronavirus/ COVID-19: \u201cRoad users who add to this pressure by not obeying the rules, and who through negligent actions cause crashes which require medical intervention, are adding to this pressure and are, quite frankly, selfish, irresponsible, and a danger to others. It is the responsibility of every person travelling to behave in such a way that their journeys are completed without incident,\u201d says the AA. Planning the Commute on Public Transport Establish before the journey which travel/ identification documentation would be required. Inquire about the payment method and the\u00a0cost\u00a0of the\u00a0fare/ ticket for the journey to avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Ensure you are aware of the routes, timetables and estimated times of arrival. Maintain a schedule that ensures plenty of people are at your bus or train stop. Choose appropriate clothing and footwear for the journey with caution - This should be comfortable but not pose additional risks. Ensure that you have a fully charged cellular phone with you and alert family and friends of your progress and estimated time\u00a0of arrival. Consider adding an emergency app on your smartphone for location tracking and easy access in an emergency. It is sound advice to carry a bottle of water with you for emergencies, thirst or dehydration. Boarding Public Transport Vehicles Avoid using vehicles that are in a poor, non-roadworthy condition. Your safety depends on the state of the vehicle you choose to travel in. Avoid overcrowded vehicles or train compartments. Allow passengers to leave the vehicle before you attempt to board. If the vehicle is not close to the curb, be careful when climbing the first step because it may be higher than you realise. Board the vehicle one-at-a-time and try not to push. Passengers should exercise care when boarding or exiting the vehicle and use the handrail when ascending or descending steps. If you drop something, never go under or near the vehicle to retrieve papers or other objects. The driver may not be able to see you. Alert the driver and ask for assistance. During inclement weather, especially snow and ice, be careful and watch your step. It is wise to wear rubbers or boots at these times. They will not only keep your feet warm and dry, but they will add more traction that will help prevent slips and falls. Strollers should be folded prior to boarding. Always leave the vehicle\u00a0with children in front of you, never behind you. Courtesy to other Passengers on Public Transport Vehicles Expect to share a small space with several passengers. You need to avoid conduct that could lead to a physical and verbal confrontation with other passengers, thereby endangering your safety, the safety of other passengers and distracting the driver. Be always courteous to both fellow passengers and the driver. The best passengers are the ones who tend to keep to themselves and quietly enjoy the ride home. Smoking will be prohibited on most passenger buses. Radios and tape recorders may be used for your listening pleasure, but earphones must be used, and the volume should be low enough so that others cannot hear it. Do not commit any act or engage in any behaviour that may cause harm, damage, or disturbance to any person or property. Refrain from having loud and/or vulgar conversations on the bus, including cellular phone conversations. Avoid unwanted conversation with other passengers tending to interfere with the other passengers\u2019 use and enjoyment of the bus; or using obscene, threatening, offensive or \u201chate\u201d speech. Do not throw things inside the bus. This could hurt other passengers or the driver. Report any suspicious items or activities immediately to the operator - Do not confront passengers on your own. Do not create unsanitary conditions on the buses or at bus stops. Help keep buses and bus stops clean by using trash and recycling receptacles. Safety from Crime Be always alert and aware of your surroundings Avoid falling asleep on shorter commutes while using public transport, especially when travelling by yourself. If you are jostled in a crowd, be aware that pickpockets might also see an opportunity. Pay attention to the safekeeping of your wallet, keys and cellular phones. Do not be flashy in exposing valuables such as jewellery, expensive cellular phones\u00a0and cash. Hold your purse tightly, close to your body. Keep your wallet in a front or inside coat pocket, or in a buttoned hip pocket. Even when on the bus, enjoy your ride but see to it that your purse or other belongings do not become unguarded. If you are travelling with small children, it is important that they are well supervised. To prevent separation from children, be sure to board together. If you are followed when you exit a vehicle/station, go to the nearest well-lit populated area, call the police or scream for help. Safety when Disembarking Public Transport Vehicles The need for safety does not stop when the vehicle comes to a standstill! Many injuries occur through absent-mindedness and pedestrian distractions when disembarking the vehicle. Be ready to leave the vehicle before it arrives at the dedicated stop. - Don't keep the driver and others waiting while you gather your belongings. Wait until the vehicle has come to a complete stop and the door has opened, before getting up from your seat. Wait until the people in the seats in front of you leave before you get up from your seat. Be sure to use the handrails when going down any steps. Be especially careful when stepping off the low\u00a0step and onto the curb or street. After leaving the vehicle move quickly away from the vehicle and out of the danger zone. The most dangerous times of any bus trip is when you are outside of the bus. There is also the danger of passing cars when you must cross the street. If you intend to cross the street after you get off a bus, watch for traffic moving around the bus. If possible, go to the sidewalk and wait for the bus to leave the area. Cross streets only in designated crosswalks and be sure to obey all traffic signals. Children, even older ones can find it difficult to cross busy roads and are often seen crossing in front or behind the bus they have just got off. Do not cross the road from in front of a bus! Public Transport, Ridesharing, E-Hailing and Mutual Respect Mutual respect of each other\u2019s differences and boundaries is key. What we do or say, even with good intentions, may make someone feel uncomfortable. Riders and drivers may feel more vulnerable at night or when travelling alone. Conversations should be about general topics\u00a0and not about asking for personal details. Actions such as staring, winking, or whistling should be avoided. It is inappropriate to comment on someone\u2019s appearance, their sexual orientation, or their gender expression. It can be perceived as intrusive to ask for someone\u2019s contact information or social media details. Ridesharing is not the place to flirt or proposition someone or engage in sexual conversations. Do not cross someone\u2019s personal boundaries. Touching is very rarely appropriate and sexual touching is never ok. Users should never engage in sexual contact even if they know one another.

In this section [while focusing mostly on road transport]\u00a0we would like to consider some of the rights and obligations of both transport operators and commuters, while also offering some suggestions for safe travel! What are the basic rights of commuters? Public transport passengers have the right to: Freedom to choose the public transport mode or vehicle from those available that they would like to use, where this choice affects their safety. Safe public transport services and roadworthy vehicles. Drivers with a valid license and professional driving permits. Reliable services that transport them according to schedule or expectation. Travel on vehicles that are not overloaded or overcrowded. Professional and courteous treatment from the drivers and staff of all public transport operators. Travel on a public transport service without experiencing any form of harassment or discrimination. Transport services that provide value for money. What should be expected from Public Transport Operators and their Passengers? Transport operators at all levels should maximise efforts to improve safety. Good road behaviour should include stopping at traffic signs, safe speed, safer following distance and not driving under the influence of alcohol. Taxi operators and bus operators must respect the rights of the passengers they transport from one place to another and commuters should be treated as contributors to social and economic development. Operators must ensure that their vehicles are driven by drivers who are medically fit to drive public passengers and are always in possession of valid professional driving permits. Drivers MUST pay attention to passenger safety, rights and respect passengers. Drivers must listen carefully to passenger complaints, identify problem areas and if appropriate take action to remedy the situation. It is also the responsibility of operators to prohibit drivers from harassing, intimidating or molesting passengers and to act against drivers who do so. Passengers have the responsibility to make sure that vehicles stop before boarding or alighting, pay the valid fare for the trip and show tickets for inspection when required. Commuters have the right to ask the driver not to exceed the number of passengers permitted to be carried in the vehicle or board a vehicle, which is overloaded. Rules of the Road and Guidance from Public Transport Operators Always Obey the Rules of the Road Refrain from any criminal activity or carrying any illegal items in your baggage. If the vehicle is fitted with seatbelts - Wear them! Do not hang outside a train or let any part of your body protrude beyond the public transport vehicle. Obey the Safety Guidance and Regulations from the Operator - If prohibited from consuming food and liquor during the trip - Obey! Be focused on good hygiene for your safety and the safety of fellow commuters. It is important to share some sound advice from the Automobile Association after the outbreak of the Coronavirus/ COVID-19: \u201cRoad users who add to this pressure by not obeying the rules, and who through negligent actions cause crashes which require medical intervention, are adding to this pressure and are, quite frankly, selfish, irresponsible, and a danger to others. It is the responsibility of every person travelling to behave in such a way that their journeys are completed without incident,\u201d says the AA. Planning the Commute on Public Transport Establish before the journey which travel/ identification documentation would be required. Inquire about the payment method and the\u00a0cost\u00a0of the\u00a0fare/ ticket for the journey to avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Ensure you are aware of the routes, timetables and estimated times of arrival. Maintain a schedule that ensures plenty of people are at your bus or train stop. Choose appropriate clothing and footwear for the journey with caution - This should be comfortable but not pose additional risks. Ensure that you have a fully charged cellular phone with you and alert family and friends of your progress and estimated time\u00a0of arrival. Consider adding an emergency app on your smartphone for location tracking and easy access in an emergency. It is sound advice to carry a bottle of water with you for emergencies, thirst or dehydration. Boarding Public Transport Vehicles Avoid using vehicles that are in a poor, non-roadworthy condition. Your safety depends on the state of the vehicle you choose to travel in. Avoid overcrowded vehicles or train compartments. Allow passengers to leave the vehicle before you attempt to board. If the vehicle is not close to the curb, be careful when climbing the first step because it may be higher than you realise. Board the vehicle one-at-a-time and try not to push. Passengers should exercise care when boarding or exiting the vehicle and use the handrail when ascending or descending steps. If you drop something, never go under or near the vehicle to retrieve papers or other objects. The driver may not be able to see you. Alert the driver and ask for assistance. During inclement weather, especially snow and ice, be careful and watch your step. It is wise to wear rubbers or boots at these times. They will not only keep your feet warm and dry, but they will add more traction that will help prevent slips and falls. Strollers should be folded prior to boarding. Always leave the vehicle\u00a0with children in front of you, never behind you. Courtesy to other Passengers on Public Transport Vehicles Expect to share a small space with several passengers. You need to avoid conduct that could lead to a physical and verbal confrontation with other passengers, thereby endangering your safety, the safety of other passengers and distracting the driver. Be always courteous to both fellow passengers and the driver. The best passengers are the ones who tend to keep to themselves and quietly enjoy the ride home. Smoking will be prohibited on most passenger buses. Radios and tape recorders may be used for your listening pleasure, but earphones must be used, and the volume should be low enough so that others cannot hear it. Do not commit any act or engage in any behaviour that may cause harm, damage, or disturbance to any person or property. Refrain from having loud and/or vulgar conversations on the bus, including cellular phone conversations. Avoid unwanted conversation with other passengers tending to interfere with the other passengers\u2019 use and enjoyment of the bus; or using obscene, threatening, offensive or \u201chate\u201d speech. Do not throw things inside the bus. This could hurt other passengers or the driver. Report any suspicious items or activities immediately to the operator - Do not confront passengers on your own. Do not create unsanitary conditions on the buses or at bus stops. Help keep buses and bus stops clean by using trash and recycling receptacles. Safety from Crime Be always alert and aware of your surroundings Avoid falling asleep on shorter commutes while using public transport, especially when travelling by yourself. If you are jostled in a crowd, be aware that pickpockets might also see an opportunity. Pay attention to the safekeeping of your wallet, keys and cellular phones. Do not be flashy in exposing valuables such as jewellery, expensive cellular phones\u00a0and cash. Hold your purse tightly, close to your body. Keep your wallet in a front or inside coat pocket, or in a buttoned hip pocket. Even when on the bus, enjoy your ride but see to it that your purse or other belongings do not become unguarded. If you are travelling with small children, it is important that they are well supervised. To prevent separation from children, be sure to board together. If you are followed when you exit a vehicle/station, go to the nearest well-lit populated area, call the police or scream for help. Safety when Disembarking Public Transport Vehicles The need for safety does not stop when the vehicle comes to a standstill! Many injuries occur through absent-mindedness and pedestrian distractions when disembarking the vehicle. Be ready to leave the vehicle before it arrives at the dedicated stop. - Don't keep the driver and others waiting while you gather your belongings. Wait until the vehicle has come to a complete stop and the door has opened, before getting up from your seat. Wait until the people in the seats in front of you leave before you get up from your seat. Be sure to use the handrails when going down any steps. Be especially careful when stepping off the low\u00a0step and onto the curb or street. After leaving the vehicle move quickly away from the vehicle and out of the danger zone. The most dangerous times of any bus trip is when you are outside of the bus. There is also the danger of passing cars when you must cross the street. If you intend to cross the street after you get off a bus, watch for traffic moving around the bus. If possible, go to the sidewalk and wait for the bus to leave the area. Cross streets only in designated crosswalks and be sure to obey all traffic signals. Children, even older ones can find it difficult to cross busy roads and are often seen crossing in front or behind the bus they have just got off. Do not cross the road from in front of a bus! Public Transport, Ridesharing, E-Hailing and Mutual Respect Mutual respect of each other\u2019s differences and boundaries is key. What we do or say, even with good intentions, may make someone feel uncomfortable. Riders and drivers may feel more vulnerable at night or when travelling alone. Conversations should be about general topics\u00a0and not about asking for personal details. Actions such as staring, winking, or whistling should be avoided. It is inappropriate to comment on someone\u2019s appearance, their sexual orientation, or their gender expression. It can be perceived as intrusive to ask for someone\u2019s contact information or social media details. Ridesharing is not the place to flirt or proposition someone or engage in sexual conversations. Do not cross someone\u2019s personal boundaries. Touching is very rarely appropriate and sexual touching is never ok. Users should never engage in sexual contact even if they know one another.

        "markdown": "Welcome toOur Blog Share This Blog : Staying Safe While Commuting: Tips for Women Travelling from PG to Work or College Commuting to work or college can be a daily challenge, but it is one that many women face while living in a PG (Paying Guest) accommodation. Whether you're heading to a corporate office near Siruseri IT Park or attending classes at a nearby university, your commute should be a safe and stress-free experience. For women, safety during transit is a top priority, especially when navigating through busy city streets or unfamiliar routes. In this blog, we\u2019ll discuss essential safety tips for women commuting from their PG accommodation, including smart commuting habits, precautions, and how to stay alert and protected during daily travels. These tips are designed to ensure peace of mind and help you navigate your commute efficiently while prioritizing your safety. Choose Safe and Well-Lit Routes: The first step toward ensuring a safe commute is selecting the right route. Whether you're taking a cab, bus, or metro, it\u2019s crucial to choose well-lit, busy streets, especially during the night or early mornings. Avoid isolated areas: Steer clear of routes that take you through dark, less-travelled streets or shortcuts through poorly lit areas, such as empty parking lots or alleyways. Plan your route: Use navigation apps like Google Maps or local commute apps to check for the safest and quickest routes. These apps often offer insights into traffic patterns and can provide alternate paths if necessary. Familiarize yourself with the area: Know the landmarks and areas around your PG accommodation. If you're new to the city or area, make sure to explore the route to your destination during daylight hours first, so you're familiar with it in case of any changes in your commute. Use Trusted Transportation Services: Opting for safe and reliable transportation is essential to ensure that your daily commute is as secure as possible. Whether you\u2019re travelling to work or college, choosing the right mode of transport can make a huge difference. Use ride-hailing apps: Services like Uber, Ola, or Lyft offer safety features like ride tracking, real-time location sharing with friends or family, and driver ratings. Always double-check the details of the driver and car before getting in. Avoid travelling with unknown drivers: If you\u2019re taking a cab or auto-rickshaw, always opt for well-known and registered services. Avoid hitching a ride from private vehicles or unmarked taxis, especially when travelling alone. Travel with a group: Whenever possible, try to commute with friends or fellow PG residents who may be travelling to the same area. Carpooling or travelling together ensures added safety and helps prevent any unforeseen incidents. Stay Connected with Family and Friends: Being connected with someone you trust while commuting provides an added layer of security. It\u2019s important to have someone who knows your whereabouts and when you expect to reach your destination. Share your trip details: Before leaving, share your ride details, including the vehicle number, driver\u2019s name, route, out with a family member or friend. Many ride-hailing apps have an option to share your ride status in real time. Set check-in points: If you are travelling a long distance, set up regular check-in times with a trusted friend or family member. Let them know when you\u2019ve boarded, and text or call them when you\u2019ve arrived safely. Use emergency contact features: Set up emergency contacts in your phone, such as trusted family members, friends, or roommates, who can be contacted if something goes wrong during your commute. Avoid Using Headphones or Becoming Distracted: While it\u2019s tempting to zone out with music or podcasts during your commute, doing so can make you less aware of your surroundings. Distractions like headphones can make you vulnerable and less alert to potential safety threats. Stay alert: Keep your ears open and pay attention to your environment. Avoid getting too absorbed in your phone or listening to music while walking or travelling in public transport. Keep your phone in your bag: If you need to use your phone, try to do it discreetly. Avoid displaying valuables like your phone or wallet openly in crowded spaces or during travel, as it can attract unwanted attention. Carry Minimal Valuables: When commuting from your PG to work or college, it\u2019s always best to carry only what you need for the day. Minimizing the number of valuables you carry can reduce your risk of theft and make it easier to stay alert. Keep valuables safe: Carry only the essentials such as your ID, wallet, and phone. Store your phone in a secure pocket or bag, ideally with a zipper, to prevent theft. Use anti-theft bags: Choose a bag with anti-theft features like hidden zippers or compartments. A crossbody bag or a backpack with sturdy straps can help prevent pickpockets from easily accessing your belongings. Be Cautious of Your Surroundings: Awareness of your environment is one of the most important aspects of staying safe while commuting. Being vigilant and knowing what\u2019s happening around you can help you avoid potential threats and react quickly if necessary. Avoid walking alone in desolate areas: If possible, avoid walking through empty or isolated areas, especially at night. Stick to busier roads and areas that are well-populated. Keep an eye on your belongings: Whether you are on a bus, in a taxi, or walking, always keep your personal belongings close and be mindful of who is nearby. Don\u2019t leave your bag unattended or out of sight. Trust Your Instincts: Your instincts are often the best defense mechanism. If something feels off, it\u2019s better to err on the side of caution and take action to protect yourself. Listen to your gut: If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe in any situation, trust your intuition and take action. This may mean getting out of a cab or asking a fellow commuter for help. Seek assistance: If you feel threatened or unsure during your commute, don\u2019t hesitate to approach a nearby shopkeeper, police officer, or someone nearby for assistance. It\u2019s always better to ask for help when you need it. Stay Calm in Emergencies: If you find yourself in an emergency situation, it\u2019s important to stay calm and focused. Panic can cloud your judgment, so take a few deep breaths and think clearly. Have an emergency plan: Familiarize yourself with the emergency services number for your city and have it saved on your phone. Also, identify places where you can go for help, such as police stations, hospitals, or public areas with a lot of people. Know when to report: If you feel that you are in immediate danger, don't hesitate to call the police or a trusted contact. It's always better to report an incident sooner rather than later. Conclusion: Commuting from your PG to work or college doesn\u2019t have to be a stressful or unsafe experience. By following these essential tips, you can ensure a safer, more comfortable commute each day. From selecting safe routes and using trusted transportation services to staying connected and aware of your surroundings, taking these simple precautions can make all the difference in protecting yourself during your travels. Remember, your safety is paramount, and by staying vigilant and prepared, you can navigate your commute confidently and enjoy the benefits of living in a PG accommodation without worrying about your safety. So, always trust your instincts, plan your route, and stay connected with others to ensure a smooth and secure commute to work or college every day.

These tips will help improve your safety and increase your confidence. Be prepared Plan your journey before you travel. Make sure you know your route and stop. Check the times of the last buses and trains. Try and have your ticket, pass or change ready in your hand so your purse or wallet is out of site. Make sure someone knows when and where you are travelling. Carry a mobile phone in case you need to contact them. When travelling in a group, arrange a meeting point in case you get separated and supply everyone with the same contact number. If travelling at night or in an unfamiliar area, try and arrange for someone to meet you at the bus stop or train station. Stay aware Be aware of your surroundings and look confident about where you are going. Avoid poorly lit areas and try to stay in sight of CCTV cameras or close to other people. Wait for a bus or train in a well-lit place near to other people whenever possible. Keep your own belongings close to you and make sure valuables are kept out of sight. Avoid listening to personal stereos, as they can prevent you from being aware of what's happening around you. On public transport When you board, choose a carriage or a seat where you feel comfortable. On a train, try to sit with other people and avoid empty carriages. If a bus is empty or it is after dark, it may be safer to stay on the lower deck and sit near the driver. If you feel uneasy, move to another seat or carriage. If you feel threatened, make as much noise as possible to attract the attention of the driver or guard. Search close search close Travel Disruption Liverpool Lime Street Closure.

These tips will help improve your safety and increase your confidence. Be prepared Plan your journey before you travel. Make sure you know your route and stop. Check the times of the last buses and trains. Try and have your ticket, pass or change ready in your hand so your purse or wallet is out of site. Make sure someone knows when and where you are travelling. Carry a mobile phone in case you need to contact them. When travelling in a group, arrange a meeting point in case you get separated and supply everyone with the same contact number. If travelling at night or in an unfamiliar area, try and arrange for someone to meet you at the bus stop or train station. Stay aware Be aware of your surroundings and look confident about where you are going. Avoid poorly lit areas and try to stay in sight of CCTV cameras or close to other people. Wait for a bus or train in a well-lit place near to other people whenever possible . Keep your own belongings close to you and make sure valuables are kept out of sight. Avoid listening to personal stereos, as they can prevent you from being aware of what's happening around you. On public transport When you board, choose a carriage or a seat where you feel comfortable. On a train, try to sit with other people and avoid empty carriages. If a bus is empty or it is after dark, it may be safer to stay on the lower deck and sit near the driver. If you feel uneasy, move to another seat or carriage. If you feel threatened, make as much noise as possible to attract the attention of the driver or guard. Search search Travel Disruption Liverpool Lime Street Closure.

We have written a lot about staying safe while traveling alone, but have generally avoided focusing only on the safety of women specifically because we believe our tips apply equally to everyone. Essentially, they boil down to but we have any more tips in this comprehensive . Still, that doesn't mean that female solo travelers don't have specific concerns. Here is our post to address them. Table of Contents 1. How to Answer \u201cThat\u201d Question Safely \u201cAre you by yourself?\u201d Solo Traveler community member Charlene recently wrote to me to say this is the one question she is frequently asked when traveling alone that she doesn't know how to answer. We took the question to the , and asked our actively engaged group of travelers on Facebook, \u201cHow would you respond to this question?\u201d There were well over 100 responses, which generally fell into the following categories. Never Answer the Question: Tricia shared how she gets ahead of the question by giving the impression that she is with others. Never answer that. A person asking you that straight away is suspect. With certain people like taxi drivers or others I don\u2019t feel comfortable with knowing I\u2019m alone, I have done a couple of things. One is I make clear before they even ask or wonder that I\u2019m on my way to meet my husband or a group of friends. I make up a story. Sometimes I say I need to make a phone call and step away just far enough that they can hear the pretend conversation. \u2026 Never advertise that you are alone. Never announce it. And if need be, pretend you are not. Bonnie takes her cue from the professionals. She said, \u201cI\nhave been practicing the art of responding politely without answering the\nquestion asked, as seasoned politicians and other public figures often do in\ninterviews. It seems like a useful skill.\u201d Assess Each Situation Individually: Many people feel that in each case you need to assess the situation by taking the circumstances into account. Deidra said that it \u201cdepends on the location, the circumstances, and who is asking. If it is a fellow traveler on a day tour or your B&B hostess, that is one thing. If it is a taxi driver or random person approaching you as you shop, then no. But I am never ashamed of it and proudly enjoy traveling solo.\u201d Patricia shared this story: I agree with everyone that it depends on the circumstances. That said, I was shopping in Torremolinos a couple of years ago, and the young, nice and friendly shopkeeper asked me if I was traveling alone. I said yes, and after some more chatting, he said: \u201cI'll marry you! I already have a wife and children here, but I can buy you a house in Morocco where I can have more than one wife. I'll also get you 100 camels. They are worth 1000 each, and you can sell one when you need cash. The things that went through my head! I politely declined, of course, and spent the rest of the week pondering what was that all about. Trust Your Instincts: A common thread running through all these responses is what I think is the most important point of all: trust your instincts. LaDell shared, \u201cI went to Africa by myself to meet up with a\ntour group. During some unscheduled time in Victoria Falls I went to the public\nmarket on my own. A young vendor said he would like to go home with me. I\nlaughed and said my husband wouldn't like that. He asked where my husband was,\nand I told him my (imaginary) husband was back at the hotel. This was not\nlikely a dangerous situation, but I believe in following my instincts when\ntraveling. It is really no one's business whether you are alone. A lie doesn't\nhurt.\u201d Ullatiana says, \u201cI have a general trust in people\u2019s good intentions and trust my gut feeling, so I normally tell the truth, that I am traveling alone. So far, it has served me well and supplied good company for a meal or some hours.\u201d Lauren made an excellent point: You aren\u2019t obligated to give any personal information to strangers. Trust your gut. 2. Dress Appropriately for the Culture and for Respect Does it matter how I dress? Yes! This is especially important for solo female travel safety in cultures where dress is a demonstration of respect and a way to get respect from others.

This number is becoming more standardized. I often use the when I land in a new destination. The greeter not only gives me a wonderful local perspective on their hometown but I also befriend someone I could call on should a problem arise. The same applies for your hotel concierge or a particularly great taxi driver. Get their cards and have them on you in case you have a need. 4. Always Have Internet Access. It's Cheap Now!

This section aims to shed light on the importance of commuter safety and provide valuable tips for a secure and worry-free commutation experience. 1.

Choose Well-lit and Crowded Areas: When waiting for public transportation or walking in unfamiliar areas, it is advisable to choose well-lit and crowded locations. Well-lit areas provide better visibility, reducing the risk of accidents or potential criminal activities. Crowded areas, on the other hand, offer a sense of security as there are more people around, making it less likely to become a target for thieves or attackers. Utilizing well-populated areas during your commute can significantly enhance your safety. 3. Utilize Safety Apps and Tools: With the advancement of technology, various safety apps and tools have been developed to aid commuters in ensuring their security. For example, many cities have implemented apps that allow users to report incidents, suspicious activities, or even request emergency assistance. Additionally, personal safety devices such as panic buttons or GPS trackers can provide an added layer of protection, especially for individuals who frequently commute alone. 4. Plan and Share Your Route: Before embarking on your commute, it is advisable to plan your route in advance. This not only helps you save time but also allows you to familiarize yourself with your surroundings. By knowing your route, you can avoid unsafe areas or potential hazards. Furthermore, sharing your route with a trusted friend or family member can provide an extra level of security. In case of any unforeseen circumstances or delays, someone will be aware of your whereabouts and can offer assistance if needed. 5. Consider Alternative Transportation Options: In some cases, choosing alternative transportation options might be the best course of action to prioritize commuter safety.

The Importance of Commuter Safety - Commuter safety: Prioritizing Safety: Tips for a Secure Commutation 2. Preparing for a Safe Commute Planning Ahead: Preparing for a Safe Commute When it comes to commuting, safety should always be a top priority. Whether you're driving, biking, or taking public transportation, taking proactive steps to ensure a secure commute can make all the difference. By planning ahead and being prepared, you can minimize potential risks and make your journey to work or school much safer. 1. Familiarize yourself with your route: One of the most important aspects of planning for a safe commute is knowing your route inside out. Take the time to study the roads or public transportation options you will be using, paying close attention to any potential hazards or areas that might require extra caution. By being familiar with your route, you can anticipate any potential dangers and plan accordingly. 2. Check the weather forecast: Weather conditions can greatly impact your commute, so it's crucial to stay informed about the forecast. If you're driving, heavy rain or snowfall can make roads slippery and increase the risk of accidents. On the other hand, if you're biking or walking, strong winds or thunderstorms can pose a threat to your safety. By checking the weather forecast in advance, you can make informed decisions about your mode of transportation and adjust your route or schedule if necessary. 3. Time your commute appropriately: Rush hour traffic can be chaotic and increase the likelihood of accidents. If possible, try to plan your commute outside of the congestion and reduce the risk of collisions. Additionally, allowing yourself extra time to reach your destination can help alleviate stress and prevent the temptation to rush, which can lead to reckless driving or careless mistakes. 4. Choose the safest mode of transportation: Depending on your circumstances, there may be multiple options available for your commute. Consider the pros and cons of each mode of transportation and choose the one that offers the highest level of safety. For instance, if you live in a busy city with limited parking options, taking public transportation or biking might be a safer choice compared to driving in heavy traffic. Evaluate the safety features, infrastructure, and potential risks associated with each option to make an informed decision. 5. Be visible and wear appropriate safety gear: Regardless of your mode of transportation, being visible to others on the road is crucial for your safety. If you're biking or walking, wear bright and reflective clothing, especially during low-light conditions. Utilize lights and reflectors on your bike to increase visibility. If you're driving, ensure your headlights, taillights, and turn signals are functioning properly. By making yourself more visible, you reduce the chances of accidents caused by others not seeing you. 6. Follow traffic rules and practice defensive driving: Adhering to traffic rules is essential for a safe commute. Observe speed limits, stop at red lights and stop signs, and yield to pedestrians when required. Additionally, practicing defensive driving techniques can help you anticipate and avoid potential hazards on the road. Stay focused, avoid distractions, and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. By being a responsible and cautious driver, you contribute to a safer commuting environment for everyone. Planning ahead and preparing for a safe commute is a vital aspect of prioritizing commuter safety.

Preventing Theft and Loss Securing Personal Belongings: Preventing Theft and Loss One of the biggest concerns for commuters is the safety and security of their personal belongings during their daily commute. Whether it's a laptop, a wallet, or a smartphone, losing or having these items stolen can not only be financially burdensome but can also lead to a breach of personal privacy. With the increasing number of thefts and incidents reported, it is crucial to take proactive belongings and prevent potential loss or theft. In this section, we will explore various strategies and tips to ensure the safety of your possessions while commuting. 1. Keep your belongings close: The first and foremost step in securing your personal belongings is to keep them close to you at all times. Avoid leaving your bag, backpack, or purse unattended, even for a brief moment. Keep your handbag zipped and close to your body, and if you're carrying a backpack, wear it on your front instead of your back. By physically holding onto your belongings, you create an additional barrier for potential thieves. 2. Utilize secure compartments: Many bags and backpacks come equipped with secure compartments specifically designed to store valuable items such as laptops or smartphones. These compartments are often padded and provide an extra layer of protection against accidental damage or theft. When purchasing a bag, consider investing in one that offers these secure compartments to ensure the safety of your valuable belongings. 3. Avoid flashy displays: It's natural to feel proud of your latest smartphone or designer handbag, but flaunting these items in public can make you an easy target for thieves. Avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself by keeping valuable items concealed whenever possible. For instance, if you're using your smartphone in a crowded train, hold it discreetly rather than waving it around for everyone to see. By minimizing the visibility of your valuable possessions, you reduce the likelihood of becoming a target. 4. Use locks and security features: Many personal belongings, such as laptops or backpacks, come with built-in security features that can act as a deterrent to potential thieves. Utilize these features by setting up passwords, enabling tracking options, or using biometric authentication to protect your devices. Additionally, invest in a sturdy lock or cable to secure your belongings to a fixed object when necessary, such as when leaving your bike unattended or storing your bag in a public locker. 5. Be vigilant in crowded areas: Crowded places, such as train stations or bus stops, are prime spots for pickpockets and thieves to operate. Stay alert and keep an eye on your surroundings, particularly in crowded areas where it's easier for someone to brush against you or distract you. If you notice any suspicious behavior or individuals, trust your instincts and move to a safer location. Remember, prevention is always better than dealing with the aftermath of a theft. 6. Consider insurance options: Despite our best efforts, sometimes theft or loss of personal belongings may still occur. In such cases, having insurance coverage can provide peace of mind and financial protection. Research different belongings, including policies that specifically cover items lost or stolen during commuting. Compare coverage options, deductibles, and premiums to find the best insurance plan that suits your needs and budget. By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of theft or loss of your personal belongings while commuting. Remember, securing your possessions is a proactive process that requires constant vigilance and awareness. By taking the necessary precautions and being mindful of your surroundings, you can ensure a safer and more secure commute.

Most transit departments have apps now that tell you when a bus or train is approaching so you can plan ahead and wait in a building nearby until your ride is almost there. Be sure to lock your doors when you get home. We hope these safety tips for commuter transportation have helped. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us here at SABRE. Stay informed.

Search Frequently Asked Questions When travelling on public transport, the companies themselves issue a lot of advice particularly in the stations or on the buses and trains themselves. However, it is worth bearing in mind the following general advice when travelling: Always sit downstairs on a bus, as near to the driver as possible. On a train try not to sit in an empty compartment. Make sure you keep hold of all personal belongings. If something or someone is bothering you, inform the guard or driver, they can stay with you if you feel uncomfortable Try and have your fare ready so you don't have to get out your purse/wallet. In relation to general personal safety try and remember the following suggestions: Try not to walk alone late at night and where possible choose well-lit main roads and walk confidently. If someone does grab your bag fighting back is not always a good idea, you do not know if your attacker has a weapon. Always be aware of your surroundings and the people around you. Reading or listening to music can be distracting. In a busy public place, try to use your mobile phone only in an emergency as it is advertising the fact that you have a phone. Whilst using your mobile phone you may be distracted, making it easier to take it from you.

Public transportation is an essential part of daily life, and knowing a few handy tips can make each trip smoother and more comfortable. In this guide, we\u2019ll walk through some smart, proactive ways to keep your travels enjoyable, efficient, and safe. Let\u2019s dive into these practical tips designed to help you travel with confidence and peace of mind. Navigating Public Transport with Confidence: Safety Tips for Women 1. Plan Ahead for a Smooth Journey When you have a clear plan for your route, you\u2019re already setting yourself up for a hassle-free trip. Spend a few minutes mapping out your route, stops, and timing. Tools: Apps like Google Maps or other public transport apps offer real-time updates to keep you on track. Benefits: Knowing your path makes it easier to navigate, reducing the chance of getting lost or sidetracked. 2. Choose Well-Lit, Busy Waiting Spots Look for waiting areas that are well-lit and populated. Busy areas not only provide better visibility but are often filled with other travellers, creating a comfortable atmosphere. Safety Tip: The more people around, the easier it is to feel at ease. A bustling area also offers more visibility if you need assistance. Tips: Make a mental note of safe waiting spots along your route, especially if you\u2019re traveling late in the evening. 3. Keep Your Belongings Secure It\u2019s easy to forget about our bags and gadgets when we\u2019re immersed in our phones or books, but a little mindfulness goes a long way. Advice: Secure your bags and avoid displaying valuables in crowded spaces. Benefits: By keeping your items close, you can enjoy your journey with fewer distractions and more awareness of your surroundings. 4. Stay Aware of Your Surroundings Keeping a light sense of awareness is a great habit that enhances your comfort and confidence on the go. While headphones or phones are convenient, remember to pause now and then and scan your surroundings. Tip: Take occasional glances around you to stay mindful of who\u2019s nearby. This lets you engage fully with your environment. Benefits: A little awareness can help you feel more secure and in control, making your journey a positive experience. 5. Sit Near the Driver or Conductor When Possible If there\u2019s an option to sit closer to the driver or in a women\u2019s section, it\u2019s worth considering. Advice: These areas are often easier to access, and proximity to authority figures can add a touch of reassurance. Benefits: It\u2019s a simple way to feel connected to someone who could provide help if needed. 6. Trust Your Intuition Sometimes, we get subtle feelings about people or situations that don\u2019t sit right. It\u2019s perfectly okay to listen to these instincts. Advice: If you ever feel the need to change seats or move closer to a different area, go ahead. Listening to your instincts can bring extra comfort. Action: Small adjustments based on intuition often contribute to smoother, stress-free travel. 7. Explore Safety Apps There are a variety of apps that make it easy to reach out if you need a hand. Safety apps can share your location or notify contacts if you need support. Examples: Apps like \"Yodda Enable Plus\" are designed with personal safety in mind and can be very useful. Benefits: Knowing you have a quick way to connect with others brings added peace of mind. 8. Stay Connected Letting a friend or family member know your travel plans can be a comforting backup. A quick message with your expected arrival time can do the trick. Tip: Use features like live location sharing on WhatsApp if you feel the need. Safety: Staying connected means someone else is aware of your journey and ready to support you if needed. 9. Consider a Self-Defense Class Self-defense isn\u2019t just about protection\u2014it\u2019s a great way to boost confidence! Knowing a few basic moves can help you feel more empowered and prepared. Techniques: Many self-defense classes offer practical skills that are easy to learn and remember. Benefits: Feeling capable is a great foundation for navigating public spaces with a sense of security. 10. Report Issues if Needed If you encounter any situation that feels out of place, don\u2019t hesitate to speak up. Whether it\u2019s to transport staff or through official channels, reporting issues can make a difference. Action: Reporting incidents helps ensure authorities stay informed, contributing to a safer environment for everyone. Impact: Your feedback helps maintain a welcoming space, making public transportation better for all travelers.

        "markdown": "8 top tips to stay safe on public transport Public transport is a quick and easy way to get around London. That said, crime sometimes takes place on public transport, so we want to share some tips to keep you safe on your travels. Try to plan your route in advance. Free TFL and Citymapper apps are great for telling you everything you need to know about your journey. It can be necessary to look at your phone to track your journey, if you do this please take your phone out somewhere where it is harder for an opportunistic thief to take it. When planning your journey check the last train, tube and bus times.\n2. Know your exits. When on any form of public transport, tube, train and bus, check where the nearest exits, fire exists and alarms are in case you need to get off for whatever reason.\n3. Stay where the people are. If you travelling by train and tube, try to avoid sitting in an empty carriage. If you are travelling by bus late at night it is always best to sit near the driver.\n4. Always use a licensed cab or black cab. A licenced cab should always have a registered licence ID number on the back of the vehicle just above the registration number plate. Try to keep a local taxi/cab firm number with you in case you need to call them or download a well-known cab service such as Uber. Before you get into the vehicle, ask who they have turned up for just to double-check.\n5. Keep your valuables secure in your bag. It can get very busy on trains, buses and tubes, which would provide a thief with an easier opportunity to take something if your valuables are on show.\n6. Trust your instincts. If you are sat somewhere and feel uncomfortable move away if you can. An example might be if you see someone behaving in a loud, aggressive or intoxicated manner. If you are on the tube you could exit at the next stop and find another carriage where you feel safer or you can alert a member of staff at the station if you feel someone needs to intervene.\n7. Spotted something suspicious? If you see anything which seems out of place on public transport, for example, a bag which does not appear to belong to anyone, please let a member of staff at the station know. It may be nothing, but it is better to be cautious. You will not be wasting anyone\u2019s time by raising the concerns you have.\n8. Report it. In the rare event that you become a victim of sexual harassment on public transport or you witness someone else who appears to be a victim to harassment, you can text 61016 or call Police on 101. Provide details of what happened, where and when. If you would like support please go to Report+Support. There is more information on travelling safely on the Transport for London website.

        "markdown": "\u00ad menu toggle Traveling solo can be an amazing experience, but it\u2019s important to take precautions to help keep yourself safe. 1. Keep Regular Contact with Family and Friends Someone needs to know when you're traveling and where you\u2019ll be to ensure your safety throughout the trip. Make sure to check in regularly and consider leaving your itinerary with someone in case an emergency does arise. Image: Atikh Bana \\| Unsplash 2. Do Your Research Before your trip, learn as much about the area as possible, so you can know what could be considered \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d areas. Utilize online travel blogs and social media and ask hotel staff for advice. The hotel staff deals with travelers every day. They\u2019ll know exactly where you should and shouldn\u2019t go, and as locals, they can point you in the direction of the best food and drinks. Another part of your research should include writing down the location of nearby hospitals and police stations. If you\u2019re traveling internationally, make sure you also know the area\u2019s equivalent to 911. 3. Travel with an Imaginary Person Whether it be a friend, significant other, or spouse, this is a good way to deter creepy people who might otherwise bother you. You can even consider wearing a fake ring. 4. Don\u2019t Overshare Save the social media posts for after you leave the location. You never know if someone with ill-intent is watching your location tags. Additionally, when you meet new people, keep personal information like where you\u2019re staying to yourself. SABRE 5. Carry a Personal Safety Product You never know whom you can encounter, and it\u2019s better to be over-prepared than not prepared at all. Whether you carry an extremely loud that will call attention to you or a or that can help you defend yourself against an attacker, a personal safety tool will help keep you safe and help you feel empowered throughout your travels. 6. Have a Hard Target Mindset Try to blend in and avoid looking like a tourist. Criminals look for soft targets or vulnerable-looking individuals who are walking with their heads down, look lost, or are walking alone. Becoming a hard target decreases your vulnerability. Practice having relaxed awareness by knowing what is happening around you so you can prepare to defend yourself if needed. Image: Clarisse Meyer \\| Unsplash 7. Make Copies of Important Documents You never know when you\u2019ll need a copy of your passport or driver\u2019s license, but you also don\u2019t want to carry these documents around with you everywhere. A copy will come in handy in case they get lost or stolen, and don\u2019t forget to email yourself a copy, too. 8. Leave the Valuables at Home Tourists are already a target for criminals, and flashy jewelry, watches, and bags will draw even more unwanted attention. You won\u2019t miss your diamonds or designer wear when you\u2019re visiting a place you\u2019ve dreamed of seeing. 9. Secure Your Stay Ask your Airbnb host to change the lock code or the hotel concierge to write down your room number instead of saying it out loud to be sure no one overhears which room you\u2019re staying in. Take your safety further by packing a portable home security alarm like the or the . These devices will easily fit in your suitcase and sound an ear-piercing alarm if someone attempts to enter a room uninvited. SABRE 10. Protect Your Finances Notify your bank and credit card companies that you\u2019ll be traveling to prevent unwanted fraud alerts. If traveling internationally, this will make it easier to withdraw money in the local currency rather than waiting at a cash exchange. You\u2019ll get better exchange rates with a local ATM, plus standing in line at a money exchange points to signs that you\u2019re a tourist. Lastly, remember to trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. Don't trust every nice person you meet.

        "markdown": "Sign Up Subscribe You are here: / / / Here Are the Fundamentals of Solo Travel Safety Master the fundamentals of solo travel safety so you can relax and enjoy your trip. Safety is a big issue when you travel solo. And while there are many specific and ingenious tips to follow (see the end of this post for links) it's most important to understand the fundamentals of solo travel safety. Make these fundamental principles your modus operandi and, with the exception of the occasional recoverable mishap, all should be well. Some travelers are anxious about solo travel and want to dig deep into everything that could possibly help ensure their safety. Others have great faith that people are good and that travel is essentially safe. It is primarily for this latter group, of which I tend to be one, that this post is written. One can't operate on faith in humanity alone. A wise approach to everyday travel situations is important. Cruise ships and patios. Everyone out for a Sunny Saturday at Hamburg port. Five Fundamentals to Keep You Safe As You Travel Solo I have a hierarchy of concerns when it comes to solo travel safety. They are: Your person Your documents Your money Your stuff The fundamentals of solo travel safety are less about money and stuff (lower on the heirarchy of safety) and more about keeping you and your documents safe. Public is safer than private . This is my number one rule. I stay in busy, public places. Out of my regular routine and in a different culture it can be hard to read situations and people well. Regardless of how comfortable I am with new acquaintances, I rarely leave a public place with them. I strategize to avoid this so that I don\u2019t insult them with my caution. For example, I may discreetly call a cab before anyone can offer me a ride, as I did in a Blues Bar in Jackson, Mississippi. I also remember that a cab is not public if shared with a stranger. Be proactive rather than reactive . One of the things I like best about solo travel is that it is social. I meet people all the time and I do so by taking the first step. I think that it is more likely that an inappropriate person will choose me than I will choose them. For this reason, I\u2019m proactive in my choices. I choose whom I talk to, where I go, and where I sit. If I need to ask for directions, my first choice is to approach a family and then perhaps a couple. I also don't assume that women are safe. I still connect with lots of people but I\u2019m less likely to be put in the position of reactively trying to get myself out of a situation when I have made the initial choice. Engage other people in your safety . When I go out\u00a0at night, I chat\u00a0with a server for a bit so they are aware that I\u2019m alone. They\u2019ll watch out for me and move unwanted attention away. If I\u2019m walking to a destination but no longer sure of my safety, I\u2019ll stop and ask directions even if I know the way. People will redirect me if I'm headed into an unsafe area. Whenever possible, I subtly engage others in my safety whether I'm feeling unsafe at that moment or not. Never be rushed into a decision . Whether you're at home or traveling, being rushed into a decision is one of the easiest ways to be conned or ripped off. It's a common strategy of people who want to take you for more than they should. It usually starts with introducing new, credible, but inaccurate information that requires you to make a decision quickly. If they won't give you the time to properly consider their offer, reject it. Get yourself\u00a0to a safe place where you can take your time to decide what you want to do. Be rude if necessary . I\u2019m usually polite and congenial with everyone I meet. It's how I was raised and it makes for a happier life. However, when it comes to safety, if polite doesn\u2019t work, I allow myself to be rude \u2013 especially when I travel alone. Regardless of whether it may hurt someone\u2019s feelings or disturb other people, if I have to, I will be rude to ensure my safety. I'll be loud or brush someone off curtly. It doesn't come up often but it has a couple of times. If you want to dig deeper into the specifics of solo travel safety, here are more posts for you.

        "html": "Sign Up Subscribe You are here: / / / Here Are the Fundamentals of Solo Travel Safety Master the fundamentals of solo travel safety so you can relax and enjoy your trip. Safety is a big issue when you travel solo. And while there are many specific and ingenious tips to follow (see the end of this post for links) it's most important to understand the fundamentals of solo travel safety. Make these fundamental principles your modus operandi and, with the exception of the occasional recoverable mishap, all should be well. Some travelers are anxious about solo travel and want to dig deep into everything that could possibly help ensure their safety. Others have great faith that people are good and that travel is essentially safe. It is primarily for this latter group, of which I tend to be one, that this post is written. One can't operate on faith in humanity alone. A wise approach to everyday travel situations is important. Cruise ships and patios. Everyone out for a Sunny Saturday at Hamburg port. Five Fundamentals to Keep You Safe As You Travel Solo I have a hierarchy of concerns when it comes to solo travel safety. They are: Your person Your documents Your money Your stuff The fundamentals of solo travel safety are less about money and stuff (lower on the heirarchy of safety) and more about keeping you and your documents safe. Public is safer than private . This is my number one rule. I stay in busy, public places. Out of my regular routine and in a different culture it can be hard to read situations and people well. Regardless of how comfortable I am with new acquaintances, I rarely leave a public place with them. I strategize to avoid this so that I don\u2019t insult them with my caution. For example, I may discreetly call a cab before anyone can offer me a ride, as I did in a Blues Bar in Jackson, Mississippi. I also remember that a cab is not public if shared with a stranger. Be proactive rather than reactive . One of the things I like best about solo travel is that it is social. I meet people all the time and I do so by taking the first step. I think that it is more likely that an inappropriate person will choose me than I will choose them. For this reason, I\u2019m proactive in my choices. I choose whom I talk to, where I go, and where I sit. If I need to ask for directions, my first choice is to approach a family and then perhaps a couple. I also don't assume that women are safe.
