The highlights (besides the Taj) was the ...\u201d\u00a0Read More How to stay safe in India Applying common sense like in any unfamiliar country will help you stay as safe as possible during your trip to India. Here are a few specifics to bear in mind. Avoid demonstrations and protests Like anywhere else, avoid large gatherings for demonstrations or protests; always follow advice in the local press. Take taxis at night While the transport system in India is efficient, try taking cabs after hours as a safety precaution Taking a taxi after nightfall can be the safest option. Make sure it is a licenced cab \u2014 although even this does not always guarantee safety. For solo travelers, especially female, the best advice is to try to avoid unnecessary journeys after nightfall whenever possible. Transport facilities like Uber is available and generally considered safe. Scams One of the biggest irritations in India is scams. While you may think you are used to this from traveling elsewhere, in India, scamming can be taken to a whole new level. Fake uniforms, fake ID cards and even fake \u2018government\u2019 tourist offices (complete with the official \u2018Incredible India\u2019 slogan) are all common. One trick involves \u2018helpful\u2019 locals striking up a conversation before directing you to one of these offices where an agent will try to sell you a tour. Unscrupulous operators will happily look you in the eye while telling you outright lies about trains being fully booked, certain areas being impossible to travel to independently and so on, all in the hope of making a sale. In general, treat unsolicited offers of help with a healthy dose of scepticism and always agree on a price before accepting any kind of service; this way, you will be able to avoid the most common tricks that tourists usually fall for. Safety for female travelers With enough wits and wisdom, traveling to India as a woman should not be difficult In recent years, several high-profile rapes have made the international press. While there is no need to be paranoid, sexual harassment of women \u2013 from catcalls to groping to more serious assaults \u2013 is a problem in India, and female travelers should exercise caution at all times. In particular, never accept rides from strangers, avoid unnecessary journeys after nightfall and avoid traveling in unfamiliar areas alone. Solo female travelers should be especially vigilant. Pickpocketing and muggings Petty theft can be a problem in India. The best advice is to keep an eye on your belongings and not to carry valuables like wallets and phones where they are easily accessible to thieves. Muggings are less common but can occur. Avoid traveling in unfamiliar or isolated areas alone, especially at night, and don\u2019t flaunt valuables like expensive watches. If you are attacked, never fight back. Hand everything over and don\u2019t resist as this may cause the situation to escalate. If you are mugged, seek help from the police immediately. Natural dangers The natural disasters you are most likely to face in India are floods from heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (generally June to October) as well as cyclones and tropical storms (especially on the east coast from September to December \u2013 the Bay of Bengal is also hit from April to June). If you are traveling during the monsoon or storm season, pay attention to weather forecasts and follow advice from local authorities. The Himalayan region is also susceptible to earthquakes, sometimes resulting in landslides and avalanche. Terrorism India is considered high-risk for terrorist activity. Although some regions (for example Jammu and Kashmir) are higher risk, anywhere can be attacked, and places that attract foreign tourists have been targeted in the past. Remain vigilant at all times, pay attention to reports in the media and avoid areas with an elevated risk of attack. Health and vaccinations Consult with your doctor about vaccinations before traveling to India Meningitis, typhoid and hepatitis A vaccinations are recommended; also, make sure tetanus and polio are up to date. Rabies vaccinations are advisable; they don\u2019t give full immunisation but give you extra time to reach a clinic for further injections if you are bitten. Since dogs, monkeys and other animals are carriers of the disease, the best policy is to avoid them. The malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquito is endemic throughout most of India, so taking anti-malaria tablets is essential. Since tablets are not 100% effective \u2014 and mosquitos can also carry the equally nasty dengue fever \u2014 you should also take precautions to avoid being bitten. Cover your skin and apply mosquito repellent, especially in the evening when Anopheles mosquitos feed. Sleeping under mosquito nets is recommended. Almost everyone who spends any time in India suffers from an upset stomach, but as long as you are sensible, you should be able to avoid anything more serious. Always drink bottled water (check the seal when you buy it) and don\u2019t eat street food that has clearly been sitting around for too long. Don't eat food from the streets that has been sitting around for a long time Others If you travel to India, try to keep up to date with the current situation in areas where you plan to travel. Many national governments provide travel information on their websites \u2014 the UK government offers an email service, sending out updates concerning security and other issues. This is an excellent travel resource, even for non-UK citizens. Other governments provide similar services. For more information on travel safety, refer to our article . See also: What else to know before a trip to India Credit cards Credit cards, particularly Visa, Mastercard and American Express, are increasingly accepted in more upmarket establishments like restaurants and hotels, but for most day-to-day purchases, you will need to rely on cash. You can change most major currencies; carrying US dollars is probably the best option. You will also be able to withdraw cash from ATMs using a debit card. India is huge India is a huge country and it can be easy to misjudge distances and travel times. When planning your trip, don\u2019t be over-ambitious with what you hope to see; if traveling overland, make sure you allow yourself plenty of time to reach your destination. Getting around India Railway system is the backbone of transport in India The backbone of transport in India is the rail system, which is extensive and generally efficient; traveling by train is a quintessential part of any trip to India. There are several different classes, ranging from luxurious to very basic. The cheapest \u201cunreserved\u201d carriages can become uncomfortably overcrowded and are best avoided. If taking an overnight service, especially in the lower-class carriages, make sure you secure your belongings and don\u2019t leave any valuables in your bags. A chain and padlock may be helpful to attach your bag while you sleep \u2014 although a determined thief may still slash your luggage with a knife. Sometimes, you might need to take a bus. The comfort and overall standard of buses varies, and the driving can be eccentric. On more modern buses, you can expect to be treated to loud Indian films from early in the morning until it\u2019s time to sleep. In cities, the go-to form of transport is the auto-rickshaw. Technically, they\u2019re metered, but the meter is rarely used. Always establish the price before you set off \u2014 knowing roughly how far you need to travel and how much it should cost will help you haggle for a fairer price. Larger cities, most famously Mumbai, are also served by venerable fleets of taxis. Although legally they should use the meters, again, expect to haggle over the fare before you start. Culture Holi is a colorful culture fest in India Aarti is a cultural activity not to miss in India There are plenty of opportunities for foreigners to make cultural mistakes, but on the whole, Indians are quite forgiving. For example, you should eat with the right hand and shouldn\u2019t touch or pass food with the left hand. However, in places frequented by tourists, most Indians won\u2019t be offended if they see you using your left hand. One area where you need to be careful is anything to do with religion. When visiting Hindu or Jain temples or Muslim mosques, always show proper respect, dress appropriately and always remove your shoes before entering. In more conservative areas, it is best for couples to avoid holding hands \u2014 although in more cosmopolitan cities like it is probably acceptable. However, shows of affection such as hugging or kissing should be avoided anywhere in India. Note that it is common to see male friends holding hands, but this is nothing more than a sign of friendship. Clothing As a rule, you should dress modestly. For women, short shorts or skirts are to be avoided, as are tops that don\u2019t cover the shoulders. The more conservative the area, the more you should cover up. For men, short shorts or sleeveless t-shirts won\u2019t earn you much respect. One exception might be on the beaches of \u2014 although even there, female topless sunbathing or full nudity for either sex is never acceptable. Weather/climate India is a huge country, and generalising about the weather is difficult. The main annual climatic event is the arrival of the monsoon, which begins in the south-west around May and progresses north and east during the following months. It normally clears up by September, although it lingers for longer in the south. Before the rains arrive, temperatures in some places can become unbearable. This means for many places, the best time to visit is after the monsoon finishes but before the punishing heat of the summer arrives \u2014 for much of the country, this is from November to March. Pollution It is recommended to wear a quality mask or scarf when going out in major cities Along with Beijing in China, now ranks among the world\u2019s most notoriously polluted cities, and on bad days, simply going outside can be a health hazard. The elderly and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions are particularly vulnerable; those at risk should avoid any strenuous activity or even consider staying indoors when the air quality is especially bad. It is recommended to wear a quality mask or scarf when going out. Tipping A culture of tipping exists in India, and giving a few rupees to waiters, porters and so on is expected and will help things run more smoothly. Related to tipping is the concept of baksheesh . Baksheesh is derived from traditional alms-giving but is now much more akin to simply fishing for bribes. For example, somebody may ask for baksheesh to unlock a gate \u2014 a gate that has only been locked for exactly this purpose. This is an annoyance, but in general, the amounts you need to hand over are minimal. Electronics to bring Feel free to take any electronics that you usually need when you travel. However, be aware that ostentatiously expensive devices will draw attention and may make you a potential target for theft. As a rule, it is better to carry as few expensive devices as possible. Indian sockets are generally the triple round pin design that is specific to the country. European plugs will work but plugs from other countries require an adaptor. Language One thing that makes traveling in India easier is the fact that English is widely spoken. Indian English is quite particular and may be a little challenging for non-native speakers at first, but you will rarely find yourself in a place where nobody understands you. Recreational drinking and intoxication It is a common sight to see sadhus indulging in marijuana, but it is still illegal In India, recreational drugs are illegal with the exception of bhang . Bhang is a paste made from the ground up buds and leaves of the cannabis plant that is then added to food or drinks. It is sold in official government bhang shops \u2014 it can be quite potent, so those who are not used to it should indulge in extreme moderation since the effects can last for many hours. As for alcohol, most of India is not the best destination if you are planning a boozy holiday. Alcohol laws vary greatly from state to state; the legal drinking age ranges from 18 to 25 and in some states depend on the type of drink. Alcohol is completely forbidden in the state of Bihar and Gujarat; in places where drinking is permitted, taxes and licensing laws make alcohol more or less difficult to obtain. For example, while it is possible to drink in , don\u2019t expect alcohol to be widely available. Goa, on the other hand, is the state where alcohol is easiest to come by. You will generally be able to enjoy a beer in hotels or restaurants frequented by Western tourists but don\u2019t expect to find many Western-style bars. Related Articles PreviousNext Traveling to India Visa requirements India has now introduced an electronic visa system. For most countries, including EU countries, USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand, applying online gives a two-month visa with two entries. The application process takes around four days. Visit for further information. It\u2019s possible to obtain longer visas by applying in person. Travel insurance It is highly advisable to take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel to India. Insurance should cover any adventurous activities you plan to engage in as well as repatriation should you require emergency medical care. Local hospitals are not of the same standard as in Western countries, so for any very serious illnesses or injuries, you are better off returning home for treatment. Airports The main airports that foreign tourist will use include Delhi, Mumbai and , although 28 international airports are able to process e-visas. Follow the link in the \u2018visa\u2019 section for the full list. So, is India safe? While a trip to India is not without risk, traveling anywhere can be dangerous, and if you\u2019re careful, there\u2019s no reason why India should concern you more than any other country. As long as you keep your wits about you \u2014 and avoid unhygienic food \u2014 India can be one of the most rewarding and eye-opening destinations anywhere in the world.

Natural dangers The natural disasters you are most likely to face in India are floods from heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (generally June to October) as well as cyclones and tropical storms (especially on the east coast from September to December \u2013 the Bay of Bengal is also hit from April to June). If you are traveling during the monsoon or storm season, pay attention to weather forecasts and follow advice from local authorities. The Himalayan region is also susceptible to earthquakes, sometimes resulting in landslides and avalanche. Terrorism India is considered high-risk for terrorist activity. Although some regions (for example Jammu and Kashmir) are higher risk, anywhere can be attacked, and places that attract foreign tourists have been targeted in the past. Remain vigilant at all times, pay attention to reports in the media and avoid areas with an elevated risk of attack. Health and vaccinations Consult with your doctor about vaccinations before traveling to India Meningitis, typhoid and hepatitis A vaccinations are recommended; also, make sure tetanus and polio are up to date. Rabies vaccinations are advisable; they don\u2019t give full immunisation but give you extra time to reach a clinic for further injections if you are bitten. Since dogs, monkeys and other animals are carriers of the disease, the best policy is to avoid them. The malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquito is endemic throughout most of India, so taking anti-malaria tablets is essential. Since tablets are not 100% effective \u2014 and mosquitos can also carry the equally nasty dengue fever \u2014 you should also take precautions to avoid being bitten. Cover your skin and apply mosquito repellent, especially in the evening when Anopheles mosquitos feed. Sleeping under mosquito nets is recommended. Almost everyone who spends any time in India suffers from an upset stomach, but as long as you are sensible, you should be able to avoid anything more serious. Always drink bottled water (check the seal when you buy it) and don\u2019t eat street food that has clearly been sitting around for too long. Don't eat food from the streets that has been sitting around for a long time Others If you travel to India, try to keep up to date with the current situation in areas where you plan to travel. Many national governments provide travel information on their websites \u2014 the UK government offers an email service, sending out updates concerning security and other issues. This is an excellent travel resource, even for non-UK citizens. Other governments provide similar services. For more information on travel safety, refer to our article . See also: What else to know before a trip to India Credit cards Credit cards, particularly Visa, Mastercard and American Express, are increasingly accepted in more upmarket establishments like restaurants and hotels, but for most day-to-day purchases, you will need to rely on cash. You can change most major currencies; carrying US dollars is probably the best option. You will also be able to withdraw cash from ATMs using a debit card. India is huge India is a huge country and it can be easy to misjudge distances and travel times. When planning your trip, don\u2019t be over-ambitious with what you hope to see; if traveling overland, make sure you allow yourself plenty of time to reach your destination. Getting around India Railway system is the backbone of transport in India The backbone of transport in India is the rail system, which is extensive and generally efficient; traveling by train is a quintessential part of any trip to India. There are several different classes, ranging from luxurious to very basic. The cheapest \u201cunreserved\u201d carriages can become uncomfortably overcrowded and are best avoided. If taking an overnight service, especially in the lower-class carriages, make sure you secure your belongings and don\u2019t leave any valuables in your bags. A chain and padlock may be helpful to attach your bag while you sleep \u2014 although a determined thief may still slash your luggage with a knife. Sometimes, you might need to take a bus. The comfort and overall standard of buses varies, and the driving can be eccentric. On more modern buses, you can expect to be treated to loud Indian films from early in the morning until it\u2019s time to sleep. In cities, the go-to form of transport is the auto-rickshaw. Technically, they\u2019re metered, but the meter is rarely used. Always establish the price before you set off \u2014 knowing roughly how far you need to travel and how much it should cost will help you haggle for a fairer price. Larger cities, most famously Mumbai, are also served by venerable fleets of taxis. Although legally they should use the meters, again, expect to haggle over the fare before you start. Culture Holi is a colorful culture fest in India Aarti is a cultural activity not to miss in India There are plenty of opportunities for foreigners to make cultural mistakes, but on the whole, Indians are quite forgiving. For example, you should eat with the right hand and shouldn\u2019t touch or pass food with the left hand. However, in places frequented by tourists, most Indians won\u2019t be offended if they see you using your left hand. One area where you need to be careful is anything to do with religion. When visiting Hindu or Jain temples or Muslim mosques, always show proper respect, dress appropriately and always remove your shoes before entering. In more conservative areas, it is best for couples to avoid holding hands \u2014 although in more cosmopolitan cities like it is probably acceptable. However, shows of affection such as hugging or kissing should be avoided anywhere in India. Note that it is common to see male friends holding hands, but this is nothing more than a sign of friendship. Clothing As a rule, you should dress modestly. For women, short shorts or skirts are to be avoided, as are tops that don\u2019t cover the shoulders. The more conservative the area, the more you should cover up. For men, short shorts or sleeveless t-shirts won\u2019t earn you much respect. One exception might be on the beaches of \u2014 although even there, female topless sunbathing or full nudity for either sex is never acceptable. Weather/climate India is a huge country, and generalising about the weather is difficult. The main annual climatic event is the arrival of the monsoon, which begins in the south-west around May and progresses north and east during the following months. It normally clears up by September, although it lingers for longer in the south. Before the rains arrive, temperatures in some places can become unbearable. This means for many places, the best time to visit is after the monsoon finishes but before the punishing heat of the summer arrives \u2014 for much of the country, this is from November to March. Pollution It is recommended to wear a quality mask or scarf when going out in major cities Along with Beijing in China, now ranks among the world\u2019s most notoriously polluted cities, and on bad days, simply going outside can be a health hazard. The elderly and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions are particularly vulnerable; those at risk should avoid any strenuous activity or even consider staying indoors when the air quality is especially bad. It is recommended to wear a quality mask or scarf when going out. Tipping A culture of tipping exists in India, and giving a few rupees to waiters, porters and so on is expected and will help things run more smoothly. Related to tipping is the concept of baksheesh . Baksheesh is derived from traditional alms-giving but is now much more akin to simply fishing for bribes. For example, somebody may ask for baksheesh to unlock a gate \u2014 a gate that has only been locked for exactly this purpose. This is an annoyance, but in general, the amounts you need to hand over are minimal. Electronics to bring Feel free to take any electronics that you usually need when you travel. However, be aware that ostentatiously expensive devices will draw attention and may make you a potential target for theft. As a rule, it is better to carry as few expensive devices as possible. Indian sockets are generally the triple round pin design that is specific to the country. European plugs will work but plugs from other countries require an adaptor. Language One thing that makes traveling in India easier is the fact that English is widely spoken. Indian English is quite particular and may be a little challenging for non-native speakers at first, but you will rarely find yourself in a place where nobody understands you. Recreational drinking and intoxication It is a common sight to see sadhus indulging in marijuana, but it is still illegal In India, recreational drugs are illegal with the exception of bhang . Bhang is a paste made from the ground up buds and leaves of the cannabis plant that is then added to food or drinks. It is sold in official government bhang shops \u2014 it can be quite potent, so those who are not used to it should indulge in extreme moderation since the effects can last for many hours. As for alcohol, most of India is not the best destination if you are planning a boozy holiday. Alcohol laws vary greatly from state to state; the legal drinking age ranges from 18 to 25 and in some states depend on the type of drink. Alcohol is completely forbidden in the state of Bihar and Gujarat; in places where drinking is permitted, taxes and licensing laws make alcohol more or less difficult to obtain. For example, while it is possible to drink in , don\u2019t expect alcohol to be widely available. Goa, on the other hand, is the state where alcohol is easiest to come by. You will generally be able to enjoy a beer in hotels or restaurants frequented by Western tourists but don\u2019t expect to find many Western-style bars.

Travel insurance It is highly advisable to take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel to India. Insurance should cover any adventurous activities you plan to engage in as well as repatriation should you require emergency medical care. Local hospitals are not of the same standard as in Western countries, so for any very serious illnesses or injuries, you are better off returning home for treatment.

While a trip to India is not without risk, traveling anywhere can be dangerous, and if you\u2019re careful, there\u2019s no reason why India should concern you more than any other country. As long as you keep your wits about you \u2014 and avoid unhygienic food \u2014 India can be one of the most rewarding and eye-opening destinations anywhere in the world.

There have been reports of artillery fire across the Line of Control and drone activity in the border states of Jammu and Kashmir (including in the city of Jammu), Rajasthan, Punjab, and Gujarat.

There are more significant safety or security concerns than you would usually find in New\u202fZealand, with some areas where you should avoid non-essential travel or avoid all travel. There is a significant threat of terrorism in India, including in areas visited by foreigners and tourists. Other things that New Zealanders travelling or living in India should be aware of are: Crime\u2014watch out for sexual crimes against women, petty\u00a0crime\u00a0and drink spiking.\u00a0Scams\u00a0are also common in India. Road travel\u2014car and motorbike accidents are common, causing injury and death. Avoid taking public transport.

Consular assistance for New Zealanders Dual citizenship is not recognised in India, which may limit our ability to provide consular assistance if you hold both Indian and New Zealand citizenship. Find out more about . Terrorism keyboard_arrow_down There is a significant threat of terrorism in India. Terrorist groups have in the past issued statements threatening to carry out attacks in India. In some areas terrorist incidents are frequent, especially Jammu and Kashmir and less frequently in parts of the northeast. There are multiple threat actors that conduct attacks in India and attribution of responsibility can be difficult. On 29 October 2019, a terrorist attack occurred in Kalgum district, Jammu and Kashmir, which resulted in 7 people being killed and 1 injured. On 14 February 2019, a terrorist attack occurred on the Jammu - Srinagar highway in Kashmir, which resulted in a number of fatalities and casualties. Terrorist attacks may be directed at national institutions within major cities, religious sites, festivals, tourist sites, hotels, markets, restaurants, cinemas, fairs, major sporting events, and public transport. Attacks have in the past targeted public places that are frequented by tourists and foreigners. Further attacks cannot be ruled out including in large cities and popular tourist destinations such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Goa. Security has been improved at major transports hubs and hotels. New Zealanders should exercise a high degree of caution and security awareness when travelling in India and avoid all rallies and demonstrations. Be particularly vigilant during election periods and in the lead-up to and during times of national significance, such as Diwali, Eid, Republic Day (January 26) and Independence Day (August 15) as these could be a particular focus for attacks. Crime keyboard_arrow_down Personal safety, particularly for women and girls is a concern in India. There have been a number of sexual offences reported against foreign women in different parts of India, including in major cities and tourist destinations. Women travellers should take particular care, even when travelling in a group and avoid travelling alone, especially at night. We recommend all travellers respect local dress codes and customs and avoid isolated areas, including beaches. There have been occasional reports of food or drink being spiked with sedatives, so extra care should be taken to ensure your food or drink is never left unattended. We recommend being cautious accepting food or drinks from strangers or recent acquaintances. There are reports where food and drink has been drugged, and travellers robbed of their possessions. Petty crime, including pickpocketing and bag-snatching is common, particularly in crowded areas such as markets, airports and on buses, metros and trains (including overnight and long-distance trains). We advise New Zealanders to be alert to their surroundings at all times and take steps to safeguard and secure their personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents. Scams are common throughout India. Some scams targeting travellers include fake tour guide services and train tickets, taxi drivers taking clients on unwanted tours and extended rides, or bank card details being copied from compromised ATMs. Scams involving the export of jewels and carpets have also occurred. Taxi drivers may approach you offering money to export such items. Don\u2019t accept any offer, no matter how convincing. If you believe you are the victim of a scam, we advise contacting the police immediately. Local travel and transportation keyboard_arrow_down Roads and driving Car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas and India leads the world in traffic-related deaths. Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout India. Most roads and vehicles are not well maintained, and drivers often do not follow traffic rules. Avoid travelling by road outside city centres after dark. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle with seatbelts. If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear. Be very careful when crossing the street, even at pedestrian crossings. Exercise vigilance and avoid taking public transport, or in taxis and auto-rickshaws after dark. If you have to use a taxi, get one from hotel taxi ranks, try to avoid hailing taxis on the street. Avoid walking alone at night in less populous and unlit areas, including city streets, village lanes and beaches. Civil unrest keyboard_arrow_down Protests and demonstrations (or \u201cbandh\u201d) occur frequently throughout India and may cause politically motivated violence. These can cause major disruption to transportation and tourist-related services. There is a risk of armed insurgent activity in Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland and Assam. Attacks by insurgents usually target Indian government and security forces, however bystanders are susceptible to being caught up and insurgents have attacked local transport and train services. Violent extremist groups are also active in the rural areas of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha to the west of Delhi, Maharashtra, Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and in remote parts of Bihar and West Bengal, primarily targeting Indian government facilities and security forces. Strikes and disruptions in these areas can affect rail and road transport networks. We advise New Zealanders to closely monitor developments that might affect their safety via local media channels. We recommend you avoid all demonstrations, protests and political campaign rallies as they could result in spontaneous violent confrontations, particularly around elections or in the wake of the death of party or government leaders. You should follow the instructions of the local authorities, including curfews and exercise a high degree of personal security awareness at all times. Be prepared to change your travel plans if there\u2019s an incident. Local laws and customs keyboard_arrow_down New Zealanders should familiarise themselves with local laws and customs in India. There are serious penalties for activities that may not be illegal in New Zealand, such as: the government ban on e-cigarettes and related products carrying a satellite phone consuming alcohol without a permit in some states or territories. Entry and exit requirements keyboard_arrow_down Airport security Expect to see increased measures being implemented at airports in response to some threats against airlines. Weather and natural hazards keyboard_arrow_down Air pollution Air pollution in some parts of India can spike to hazardous levels, especially during winter months and those with pre-existing medical conditions, the very young, or the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.

Contact your airline for up-to-date information. Indian authorities have closed the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari Border (Land border between India and Pakistan in the state of Punjab) with immediate effect. There are more significant safety or security concerns than you would usually find in New\u202fZealand, with some areas where you should avoid non-essential travel or avoid all travel. There is a significant threat of terrorism in India, including in areas visited by foreigners and tourists. Other things that New Zealanders travelling or living in India should be aware of are: Crime\u2014watch out for sexual crimes against women, petty crime and drink spiking. Scams are also common in India. Road travel\u2014car and motorbike accidents are common, causing injury and death. Avoid taking public transport. Civil unrest\u2014demonstrations and protests are common, and may result in violence. New Zealanders living or travelling in India should have a comprehensive travel insurance policy in place that includes provision for medical evacuation by air. See below for detailed travel advice. Consular assistance for New Zealanders Dual citizenship is not recognised in India, which may limit our ability to provide consular assistance if you hold both Indian and New Zealand citizenship. Find out more about . Terrorism keyboard_arrow_down There is a significant threat of terrorism in India. Terrorist groups have in the past issued statements threatening to carry out attacks in India. In some areas terrorist incidents are frequent, especially Jammu and Kashmir and less frequently in parts of the northeast. There are multiple threat actors that conduct attacks in India and attribution of responsibility can be difficult. On 29 October 2019, a terrorist attack occurred in Kalgum district, Jammu and Kashmir, which resulted in 7 people being killed and 1 injured. On 14 February 2019, a terrorist attack occurred on the Jammu - Srinagar highway in Kashmir, which resulted in a number of fatalities and casualties. Terrorist attacks may be directed at national institutions within major cities, religious sites, festivals, tourist sites, hotels, markets, restaurants, cinemas, fairs, major sporting events, and public transport. Attacks have in the past targeted public places that are frequented by tourists and foreigners. Further attacks cannot be ruled out including in large cities and popular tourist destinations such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Goa. Security has been improved at major transports hubs and hotels. New Zealanders should exercise a high degree of caution and security awareness when travelling in India and avoid all rallies and demonstrations. Be particularly vigilant during election periods and in the lead-up to and during times of national significance, such as Diwali, Eid, Republic Day (January 26) and Independence Day (August 15) as these could be a particular focus for attacks. Crime keyboard_arrow_down Personal safety, particularly for women and girls is a concern in India. There have been a number of sexual offences reported against foreign women in different parts of India, including in major cities and tourist destinations. Women travellers should take particular care, even when travelling in a group and avoid travelling alone, especially at night. We recommend all travellers respect local dress codes and customs and avoid isolated areas, including beaches. There have been occasional reports of food or drink being spiked with sedatives, so extra care should be taken to ensure your food or drink is never left unattended. We recommend being cautious accepting food or drinks from strangers or recent acquaintances. There are reports where food and drink has been drugged, and travellers robbed of their possessions. Petty crime, including pickpocketing and bag-snatching is common, particularly in crowded areas such as markets, airports and on buses, metros and trains (including overnight and long-distance trains). We advise New Zealanders to be alert to their surroundings at all times and take steps to safeguard and secure their personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents. Scams are common throughout India. Some scams targeting travellers include fake tour guide services and train tickets, taxi drivers taking clients on unwanted tours and extended rides, or bank card details being copied from compromised ATMs. Scams involving the export of jewels and carpets have also occurred. Taxi drivers may approach you offering money to export such items. Don\u2019t accept any offer, no matter how convincing. If you believe you are the victim of a scam, we advise contacting the police immediately. Local travel and transportation keyboard_arrow_down Roads and driving Car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas and India leads the world in traffic-related deaths. Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout India. Most roads and vehicles are not well maintained, and drivers often do not follow traffic rules. Avoid travelling by road outside city centres after dark. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle with seatbelts. If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear. Be very careful when crossing the street, even at pedestrian crossings. Exercise vigilance and avoid taking public transport, or in taxis and auto-rickshaws after dark. If you have to use a taxi, get one from hotel taxi ranks, try to avoid hailing taxis on the street. Avoid walking alone at night in less populous and unlit areas, including city streets, village lanes and beaches. Civil unrest keyboard_arrow_down Protests and demonstrations (or \u201cbandh\u201d) occur frequently throughout India and may cause politically motivated violence. These can cause major disruption to transportation and tourist-related services. There is a risk of armed insurgent activity in Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland and Assam. Attacks by insurgents usually target Indian government and security forces, however bystanders are susceptible to being caught up and insurgents have attacked local transport and train services. Violent extremist groups are also active in the rural areas of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha to the west of Delhi, Maharashtra, Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and in remote parts of Bihar and West Bengal, primarily targeting Indian government facilities and security forces. Strikes and disruptions in these areas can affect rail and road transport networks. We advise New Zealanders to closely monitor developments that might affect their safety via local media channels. We recommend you avoid all demonstrations, protests and political campaign rallies as they could result in spontaneous violent confrontations, particularly around elections or in the wake of the death of party or government leaders. You should follow the instructions of the local authorities, including curfews and exercise a high degree of personal security awareness at all times. Be prepared to change your travel plans if there\u2019s an incident. Local laws and customs keyboard_arrow_down New Zealanders should familiarise themselves with local laws and customs in India. There are serious penalties for activities that may not be illegal in New Zealand, such as: the government ban on e-cigarettes and related products carrying a satellite phone consuming alcohol without a permit in some states or territories. Entry and exit requirements keyboard_arrow_down Airport security Expect to see increased measures being implemented at airports in response to some threats against airlines. Weather and natural hazards keyboard_arrow_down Air pollution Air pollution in some parts of India can spike to hazardous levels, especially during winter months and those with pre-existing medical conditions, the very young, or the elderly may be particularly vulnerable. If you intend to travel or live in India, you may wish to seek medical advice in advance of your trip. Severe weather The monsoon season in India is normally from late June to early October. During this time, there is a heightened risk of severe flooding and landslides. Check local weather forecasts and in the event of a flood, always follow the instructions of local authorities.

        "markdown": "Readers\u2019 Take: Reclaim the night, curb crime By Jan 22, 2022 02:00 AM IST Share Via Copy Link Tricity readers feel that police presence must be increased at secluded spots, where crimes are most likely to take place. Special women-run public transport can also help women who have to commute at night. Well-lit roads, closed-circuit television cameras, 24/7 police helpline and a prompt response team can also go a long way Sensitisation at grassroots required Tricity residents feel that police presence must be increased at secluded spots, where crimes are most likely to take place. (Biswajit Debnath/HT) Though the importance of policing cannot be denied, making tricity safe for women needs to be addressed at other levels too. The fear and insecurities created by the pandemic are a major trigger, leading to venting of anger and frustration. Despite societal changes, we are still predominantly in a patriarchal setup. To counter this, we need sensitisation and awareness drives at the grassroots level, for which the police and the civil society needs to work in tandem. Renu Mathur, Panchkula Public spaces & transport should be made safer According to World Health Organisation (WHO), one in three women has experienced some kind of physical or sexual violence. To eliminate this problem, simple measures like shifting a bus stop, installing streetlights or constructing public toilets can greatly improve women\u2019s safety in tricity. Public transport is crucial for economic development and should be made safer at night. Raising awareness is the first step to building support and mobilising key stakeholders to work to reduce and prevent violence and the threat of violence against women and girls in public spaces. Art is one powerful way to bring attention to harassment. Technology is having a profound impact on women\u2019s ability to raise awareness against sexual harassment, report assault and unsafe areas, share personal stories, and mobilise across tricity. It helps to empower women to stand up for their right to safe public spaces. Vineet Gandhi, Chandigarh Track criminals hiding in plain sight Firstly, the major reason for crimes against women is the presence of criminals and inimical elements who hide in plain sight in the civilised society. Other reasons are many, but not nearly as significant as this, the most overarching one. Consequently, targeting them and bringing down them to book should be the society\u2019s highest priority. We have technology and means to do so, but lack the single point, undistracted focus that is at the heart of any strategy to counter this looming menace. A highly planned city as Chandigarh tricity has only so many places a criminal can breed and slink away to after perpetrating a crime. Such areas have been identified and sanitised previously too, what\u2019s needed is a will to completely eliminate criminals once it\u2019s clear there\u2019s even a shadow of doubt something may have been done that can be termed as crime adjacent. Any delay or half-hearted measure can only delay the inevitable showdown that civilised society needs to eventually have with criminals. Ajay Dogra, Panchkula Virus not the only enemy Imposing night curfew to control the spread of Covid-19 infection has created more problems than it was meant to solve. Rape of a female passenger by an autorikshaw driver in a place like Sector 17 during curfew hours, is the crime that could not possibly occur if there was no curfew. Murder of two women in Maloya and Mauli Jagran last week, can also be somewhere attributed to the fact that criminals could easily get away with the crime without the possibility of any witness around. UT administration will do to review the decision or else ensure additional police patrolling and proper illumination at all the secluded places in the city. SC Luthra, Chandigarh Promote gender equity Violence against women is the manifestation of historically unequal power relations between man and woman. Successful prevention requires political commitment and leadership for implementing laws and policies efficiently to promote gender equity. Police and the judicial system are unfortunately not as active and prompt as desired for the delivery of justice to the victims. Most of the crimes in Chandigarh, in the recent past, were committed by three-wheeler drivers and persons from other states. Police should do well to get a fresh verification of three-wheeler drivers, tents and PGs done. All religious and educational institutions should promote respect for women and girl children. Parents should also educate their children against crime and criminals. Kidar Nath Sharma, via email Self defence classes for all Self defence is a means by which we can protect ourselves from those who would do us harm. It entails simple things like using our body parts, things in our possession like keyrings etc as a means of defending ourselves. Self-defence is for everybody. Today almost everyone from teenagers to grannies, to office executives and retired couples, need at least a basic knowledge of simple self-protection measures. Learning martial arts can be very rewarding at a personal level, but for most people. People who have little physical skill can easily absorb and use the basic forms of self-defence. B S Handa, via email Better infrastructure Incidents of violence against women and girls are increasing and continue to plague roads, public transport facilities and places of recreation too. To make tricity roads safer for women, the administration needs to improve the streetlight cover in the city, introduce women-friendly transportation facilities, bring more CCTV cameras, equip all public transport with GPS-tracking and increasing policing. Sessions on prevention of sexual harassment should be held for both men and women. Also, we need to make girls and women self-sufficient to protect themselves in case of any eventuality. Prabhjot Nagpal Instill fear of law in criminals The society must stop viewing women as the weaker sex. Self-defence classes will go a long way in helping women protect themselves. Besides, the age-old patriarchy must go and women and girls must be encouraged to speak up against form of harassment. Policing must be strengthened and law enforcement agencies must also play an active role in bringing to book the perpetrators so that women and girls feel more confident about speaking out about such harassment. Stricter punishment can help instill the fear of law in the criminals. Abhishek Kumar, Chandigarh Keep tabs on cab, auto drivers Chandigarh administration has failed to curb the menace of crime rate against women in the city. Dense forest areas, with no streetlights and no cop deployment, give ample opportunities to the criminals to commit crime. Security should be beefed up at secluded places and special light arrangements should be made to avoid such incidents. During winters, night patrolling should be beefed up and cops should be deployed at every one kilometre. Illegal occupants, migrants, and squatters should be checked. ID cards with their background written on it should be made mandatory for auto and cab drivers. All public transports should be connected to a centralised system to keep track of the drivers to safeguard women against crime in the city. Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali Policies for women\u2019s safety It is unfortunate that women are considered to be objects of desire as a result of which heinous crimes of murders and rapes are committed by the unscrupulous elements. Policy rejig is needed to dent this menace. Efficient police patrolling at night must coupled with police and law enforcement agencies working together. Raj Kumar Kapoor, Ropar Women safety is a basic necessity Chandigarh has a woman MP and a woman mayor, yet still women\u2019s safety becomes an agenda only after some untoward incidents occur. Women safety should be a priority for the lawmakers. Better street lighting, better CCTV coverage, panic buttons at public places etc should be created. Police too needs to up the ante in this matter. Kampreet Gill, Chandigarh Night patrolling needs to be strengthened Crime graph is vertically rising in the tricity. Rape, murder, carjacking, snatchings are happening daily. Not only women but children, elderly and individuals are victims. Senior police officials and administration officers should supervise night patrolling. Forest guards should be deployed 24 hours in forest area as most crimes are committed there. Navjot Singh Chhabra, Mohali Harsher punishment for crimes against women Women have been suffering atrocities from partners, strangers etc. It is high time that we find ways to protect women from heinous crimes like rape and murder. We need more cops on the ground, especially women cops, to make women feel safer. Also, we need harsher punishments for those perpetuate crimes against women. Kundan Lal Sharma, Mohali Hold cops accountable The three recent crimes against women that took place in the city must enrage us all. A city that cannot ensure safety for its women is of no good. There must be exemplary punishment for the perpetrators of crime. Law and order seems to have gone out of order in the city. The in-charge of the police station concerned in the area must be held accountable for crimes on streets. Dark spots in the city also need urgent police verification and the drivers of all autos and cabs must be given strict orders to ensure the safety of their passengers. Time to time workshops for them can prove handy. P Mehta, via email No lessons learnt from the past The recent cases of crimes against women, are not the first case. In the past too, many such crimes, involving auto drivers, have taken place. But nothing was done to check such criminals. Why don\u2019t autos have GPS systems like cabs. Most autos are run by migrants, who feel that they can flee to their hometown easily after the crime. Introducing women-only buses for educational institutions, deployment of more women constables in plain clothes at public places etc will also help. Also, registering of complaints must be made easier for women. Advocate Vijay Malia, Chandigarh Intensify night patrol UT is facing a rise in crimes against women. To check it, police should intensify night patrol on bicycle or on foot in civilian clothes. As the three cities are clinging to each other with multiple entry points, their police should also work in tandem. All dark areas should be illuminated properly. Police and citizens through Residents Welfare Association should work together to eliminate the crime. Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd.), Chandigarh Political, administrative will to bring change missing Police and administration make many policies to tackle women\u2019s safety issues but sadly, are able to achieve precious little as the problems at the grassroots levels has not been addressed. Every few months, we come across cases of rapes and murders. When such a crime takes place, initially, there is a lot of hue and cry but slowly, it dies down. Unless there is political and administrative will, nothing much will change. Aarti Verma, Panchkula Policing needs to improve To make city safer for women, police should keep patrolling external as well as internal roads all the time. Hidden CCTV cameras with audio should be installed on the city roads. Secret nakas should be conducted. Police helpline should be made operational. Only vigilant cops should be recruited by experienced recruiters. There should be security in markets, hotels and restaurants. Cops should not be lazy and should remain alert all the time. Cops should investigate the crimes properly. Saikrit Gulati, Chandigarh Plug loopholes in system The recent rise of various forms of crimes against women in the tricity area has raised many questions regarding the safety of women especially during night. The primary reason of course is the poor policing but we cannot overlook other reasons also behind all such crimes. The criminals are aware of the gaping loopholes in all the existing laws towards protection of women. There is no fear of police and other law enforcement agencies in the minds of the criminals. At the family level, we need to inculcate values in boys regarding extending respect to all females in the society. Moral education in schools can also help towards drilling values in our society. All women should also be taught skills to defend themselves in case of assault. Anil Kumar Yadav, Chandigarh Keep safety tools like pepper spray handy Police is not alone to blame in this issue. Well-lit roads and CCTV cameras on every road can help curb crimes against women. Girls should also carry some kind of safety tool, for example a pepper spray, a small knife or something with which they can attack their attackers. Women also need to equip themselves with self-defence techniques. While venturing out at night, it is good idea to share your location with a trusted confidante so that help can arrive quickly in case of some trouble. Ishita Nara, Panchkula Round the clock surveillance Crime against women has increased in tricity. It is high time that separate women police cells be opened in each police station for speedy trial of women-related crimes NGOs and social organisations should also be involved in carrying out night patrolling. Lastly, high definition CCTV cameras be installed and round-the-clock surveillance for early detection of crime in tricity must be imposed. Col TBS Bedi (retd), Mohali Field staff must be increased Crimes against women are a matter of concern not only for the Chandigarh administration, but all of India. Crimes against women like rape, eve-teasing and domestic violence are increasing every year. Each time, the administration demands strict against the accused, but in maximum cases, they are unable to punish all those guilty. More field staff has to be deployed and CCTV cameras must be installed in every sector and village. Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Admns must put plan in place The three incidents of horrific crimes against women reported from tricity in the past week are truly horrifying. It seems that police and administrations of tricity are not taking any lessons from the past and if proper action plans were in place, these crimes could have been avoided. The security of citizens of tricity, especially women, should be the top priority of the police and to ensure that, there has to be 24X7 vigilance on all the roads through patrolling vans and CCTV cameras must be installed in every place. Sanjay Chopra, Mohali Patrolling must be intensified The rising graph of heinous crimes against women has put the nation and society to shame. It is obligatory to make public spaces safe for women at all times. The forest areas in Mauili Jagran and Maloya are especially unsafe, as the streets are poorly-lit. Police patrolling must be intensified and the municipal corporation(MC) should install streetlights at the earliest. Registering autorickshaw drivers should also be made mandatory. While the strictest action should be taken against the culprits, it is imperative to change the patriarchal mindset of the society at large. Usha Verma, Chandigarh Auto drivers must carry id cards The police department is totally failing to control crime, even during curfew .The authorities of tricity must form a sub-committee to control crime and the police must be instructed to perform their duties properly. Auto drivers must carry their identity cards and display the owner\u2019s details on the vehicle. Vehicles should be impounded if the driver does not provide documents Police patrolling needs to be increased in the winter nights and they should conduct inspections at vacant plots and forest area. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali Women must be cautious Apart from police patrolling being increased, women must also be cautious. They must not wait at secluded dark places and avoid taking lift from unknown people. If they take a lift in case of an emergency, they should take a photo of the vehicle and forward to any friend immediately. Inderjit Singh Sidhu, Mohali Admn needs to wake up to women safety It has once again come to the fore that the city is far from safe for women. What is more shocking that no arrests have been made for the cold-blooded murders. If the administration is serious about making the city safer for women, it needs to go for a complete overhaul of the police force. Patrolling needs to be stepped up in and around the vulnerable spots across the city. The authorities concerned need to identify the dark spots and order installation of streetlights around forested areas. Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Reader of the week Self-defence is the best weapon The three crimes \u2013 two murders and a rape \u2013 that took place in the city in the last few weeks bring out the loopholes in the system. Cops need to be stationed, not just at crowded spots, but also in secluded areas where such crimes are most likely to take place. Women should arm themselves with pepper spray etc while venturing out at night. Knowledge of self-defence techniques will be an added benefit. Such lessons must be compulsorily imparted in schools and colleges. Police should also promote women safety apps, with which help can be called for with the click of a button. Omika Sachdeva, via email Experts Safer streets We have identified dark spots in the city and written to authorities to install streetlights there. Night patrolling has also been increased and all calls to police control room, especially reporting crimes against women are immediately attended. A night-drop facility is also available with Chandigarh police. Shruti Arora, ASP, (South), Chandigarh Awareness Women safety apps, installation of CCTV cameras, awareness regarding the safest routes to travel at night, and self-defense techniques can help ensure women\u2019s safety. Harjeet Singh, Mohali senior superintendent of police Action Police have taken every precaution to ensure that there is a check on crime rate. We have installed CCTV cameras, lights at dark spots, have made women aware. But still if any such heinous crime happens, then it is dealt at priority by police force. Any crime against woman is taken very seriously and immediate action is taken. Mamta Sodha, ACP, Panchkula Community policing Community policing is needed and each neighbourhood must hire at least a chowkidaar at night so that women feel safe. RWA members must also contribute more as the police and authorities are already doing a lot. CCTV cameras can help make neighborhoods safer. Manoj Kumar, associate professor of sociology at PGGCG- Sector 11, Chandigarh Mindset change Authorities must increase patrolling in suburban parts, where most crimes take place. However, this is a short-term fix. To tackle this problem, awareness needs to be imparted at school-level to change the mindset of people. The employers must also arrange safe transportation for women who work the night shift so that such incidents can be avoided.

A highly planned city as Chandigarh tricity has only so many places a criminal can breed and slink away to after perpetrating a crime. Such areas have been identified and sanitised previously too, what\u2019s needed is a will to completely eliminate criminals once it\u2019s clear there\u2019s even a shadow of doubt something may have been done that can be termed as crime adjacent. Any delay or half-hearted measure can only delay the inevitable showdown that civilised society needs to eventually have with criminals. Ajay Dogra, Panchkula Virus not the only enemy Imposing night curfew to control the spread of Covid-19 infection has created more problems than it was meant to solve. Rape of a female passenger by an autorikshaw driver in a place like Sector 17 during curfew hours, is the crime that could not possibly occur if there was no curfew. Murder of two women in Maloya and Mauli Jagran last week, can also be somewhere attributed to the fact that criminals could easily get away with the crime without the possibility of any witness around. UT administration will do to review the decision or else ensure additional police patrolling and proper illumination at all the secluded places in the city. SC Luthra, Chandigarh Promote gender equity Violence against women is the manifestation of historically unequal power relations between man and woman. Successful prevention requires political commitment and leadership for implementing laws and policies efficiently to promote gender equity. Police and the judicial system are unfortunately not as active and prompt as desired for the delivery of justice to the victims. Most of the crimes in Chandigarh, in the recent past, were committed by three-wheeler drivers and persons from other states. Police should do well to get a fresh verification of three-wheeler drivers, tents and PGs done. All religious and educational institutions should promote respect for women and girl children. Parents should also educate their children against crime and criminals. Kidar Nath Sharma, via email Self defence classes for all Self defence is a means by which we can protect ourselves from those who would do us harm. It entails simple things like using our body parts, things in our possession like keyrings etc as a means of defending ourselves. Self-defence is for everybody. Today almost everyone from teenagers to grannies, to office executives and retired couples, need at least a basic knowledge of simple self-protection measures. Learning martial arts can be very rewarding at a personal level, but for most people. People who have little physical skill can easily absorb and use the basic forms of self-defence. B S Handa, via email Better infrastructure Incidents of violence against women and girls are increasing and continue to plague roads, public transport facilities and places of recreation too. To make tricity roads safer for women, the administration needs to improve the streetlight cover in the city, introduce women-friendly transportation facilities, bring more CCTV cameras, equip all public transport with GPS-tracking and increasing policing. Sessions on prevention of sexual harassment should be held for both men and women. Also, we need to make girls and women self-sufficient to protect themselves in case of any eventuality. Prabhjot Nagpal Instill fear of law in criminals The society must stop viewing women as the weaker sex. Self-defence classes will go a long way in helping women protect themselves. Besides, the age-old patriarchy must go and women and girls must be encouraged to speak up against form of harassment. Policing must be strengthened and law enforcement agencies must also play an active role in bringing to book the perpetrators so that women and girls feel more confident about speaking out about such harassment. Stricter punishment can help instill the fear of law in the criminals. Abhishek Kumar, Chandigarh Keep tabs on cab, auto drivers Chandigarh administration has failed to curb the menace of crime rate against women in the city. Dense forest areas, with no streetlights and no cop deployment, give ample opportunities to the criminals to commit crime. Security should be beefed up at secluded places and special light arrangements should be made to avoid such incidents. During winters, night patrolling should be beefed up and cops should be deployed at every one kilometre. Illegal occupants, migrants, and squatters should be checked. ID cards with their background written on it should be made mandatory for auto and cab drivers. All public transports should be connected to a centralised system to keep track of the drivers to safeguard women against crime in the city. Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali Policies for women\u2019s safety It is unfortunate that women are considered to be objects of desire as a result of which heinous crimes of murders and rapes are committed by the unscrupulous elements. Policy rejig is needed to dent this menace. Efficient police patrolling at night must coupled with police and law enforcement agencies working together. Raj Kumar Kapoor, Ropar Women safety is a basic necessity Chandigarh has a woman MP and a woman mayor, yet still women\u2019s safety becomes an agenda only after some untoward incidents occur. Women safety should be a priority for the lawmakers. Better street lighting, better CCTV coverage, panic buttons at public places etc should be created. Police too needs to up the ante in this matter. Kampreet Gill, Chandigarh Night patrolling needs to be strengthened Crime graph is vertically rising in the tricity. Rape, murder, carjacking, snatchings are happening daily. Not only women but children, elderly and individuals are victims. Senior police officials and administration officers should supervise night patrolling. Forest guards should be deployed 24 hours in forest area as most crimes are committed there. Navjot Singh Chhabra, Mohali Harsher punishment for crimes against women Women have been suffering atrocities from partners, strangers etc. It is high time that we find ways to protect women from heinous crimes like rape and murder. We need more cops on the ground, especially women cops, to make women feel safer. Also, we need harsher punishments for those perpetuate crimes against women. Kundan Lal Sharma, Mohali Hold cops accountable The three recent crimes against women that took place in the city must enrage us all. A city that cannot ensure safety for its women is of no good. There must be exemplary punishment for the perpetrators of crime. Law and order seems to have gone out of order in the city. The in-charge of the police station concerned in the area must be held accountable for crimes on streets. Dark spots in the city also need urgent police verification and the drivers of all autos and cabs must be given strict orders to ensure the safety of their passengers. Time to time workshops for them can prove handy. P Mehta, via email No lessons learnt from the past The recent cases of crimes against women, are not the first case. In the past too, many such crimes, involving auto drivers, have taken place. But nothing was done to check such criminals. Why don\u2019t autos have GPS systems like cabs. Most autos are run by migrants, who feel that they can flee to their hometown easily after the crime. Introducing women-only buses for educational institutions, deployment of more women constables in plain clothes at public places etc will also help. Also, registering of complaints must be made easier for women. Advocate Vijay Malia, Chandigarh Intensify night patrol UT is facing a rise in crimes against women. To check it, police should intensify night patrol on bicycle or on foot in civilian clothes. As the three cities are clinging to each other with multiple entry points, their police should also work in tandem. All dark areas should be illuminated properly. Police and citizens through Residents Welfare Association should work together to eliminate the crime. Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd.), Chandigarh Political, administrative will to bring change missing Police and administration make many policies to tackle women\u2019s safety issues but sadly, are able to achieve precious little as the problems at the grassroots levels has not been addressed. Every few months, we come across cases of rapes and murders. When such a crime takes place, initially, there is a lot of hue and cry but slowly, it dies down. Unless there is political and administrative will, nothing much will change. Aarti Verma, Panchkula Policing needs to improve To make city safer for women, police should keep patrolling external as well as internal roads all the time. Hidden CCTV cameras with audio should be installed on the city roads. Secret nakas should be conducted. Police helpline should be made operational. Only vigilant cops should be recruited by experienced recruiters. There should be security in markets, hotels and restaurants. Cops should not be lazy and should remain alert all the time. Cops should investigate the crimes properly. Saikrit Gulati, Chandigarh Plug loopholes in system The recent rise of various forms of crimes against women in the tricity area has raised many questions regarding the safety of women especially during night. The primary reason of course is the poor policing but we cannot overlook other reasons also behind all such crimes. The criminals are aware of the gaping loopholes in all the existing laws towards protection of women. There is no fear of police and other law enforcement agencies in the minds of the criminals. At the family level, we need to inculcate values in boys regarding extending respect to all females in the society. Moral education in schools can also help towards drilling values in our society. All women should also be taught skills to defend themselves in case of assault. Anil Kumar Yadav, Chandigarh Keep safety tools like pepper spray handy Police is not alone to blame in this issue. Well-lit roads and CCTV cameras on every road can help curb crimes against women. Girls should also carry some kind of safety tool, for example a pepper spray, a small knife or something with which they can attack their attackers. Women also need to equip themselves with self-defence techniques. While venturing out at night, it is good idea to share your location with a trusted confidante so that help can arrive quickly in case of some trouble. Ishita Nara, Panchkula Round the clock surveillance Crime against women has increased in tricity. It is high time that separate women police cells be opened in each police station for speedy trial of women-related crimes NGOs and social organisations should also be involved in carrying out night patrolling. Lastly, high definition CCTV cameras be installed and round-the-clock surveillance for early detection of crime in tricity must be imposed. Col TBS Bedi (retd), Mohali Field staff must be increased Crimes against women are a matter of concern not only for the Chandigarh administration, but all of India. Crimes against women like rape, eve-teasing and domestic violence are increasing every year. Each time, the administration demands strict against the accused, but in maximum cases, they are unable to punish all those guilty. More field staff has to be deployed and CCTV cameras must be installed in every sector and village. Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Admns must put plan in place The three incidents of horrific crimes against women reported from tricity in the past week are truly horrifying. It seems that police and administrations of tricity are not taking any lessons from the past and if proper action plans were in place, these crimes could have been avoided. The security of citizens of tricity, especially women, should be the top priority of the police and to ensure that, there has to be 24X7 vigilance on all the roads through patrolling vans and CCTV cameras must be installed in every place. Sanjay Chopra, Mohali Patrolling must be intensified The rising graph of heinous crimes against women has put the nation and society to shame. It is obligatory to make public spaces safe for women at all times. The forest areas in Mauili Jagran and Maloya are especially unsafe, as the streets are poorly-lit. Police patrolling must be intensified and the municipal corporation(MC) should install streetlights at the earliest. Registering autorickshaw drivers should also be made mandatory. While the strictest action should be taken against the culprits, it is imperative to change the patriarchal mindset of the society at large. Usha Verma, Chandigarh Auto drivers must carry id cards The police department is totally failing to control crime, even during curfew .The authorities of tricity must form a sub-committee to control crime and the police must be instructed to perform their duties properly. Auto drivers must carry their identity cards and display the owner\u2019s details on the vehicle. Vehicles should be impounded if the driver does not provide documents Police patrolling needs to be increased in the winter nights and they should conduct inspections at vacant plots and forest area. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali Women must be cautious Apart from police patrolling being increased, women must also be cautious. They must not wait at secluded dark places and avoid taking lift from unknown people. If they take a lift in case of an emergency, they should take a photo of the vehicle and forward to any friend immediately. Inderjit Singh Sidhu, Mohali Admn needs to wake up to women safety It has once again come to the fore that the city is far from safe for women. What is more shocking that no arrests have been made for the cold-blooded murders. If the administration is serious about making the city safer for women, it needs to go for a complete overhaul of the police force. Patrolling needs to be stepped up in and around the vulnerable spots across the city. The authorities concerned need to identify the dark spots and order installation of streetlights around forested areas. Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Reader of the week Self-defence is the best weapon The three crimes \u2013 two murders and a rape \u2013 that took place in the city in the last few weeks bring out the loopholes in the system. Cops need to be stationed, not just at crowded spots, but also in secluded areas where such crimes are most likely to take place. Women should arm themselves with pepper spray etc while venturing out at night. Knowledge of self-defence techniques will be an added benefit. Such lessons must be compulsorily imparted in schools and colleges. Police should also promote women safety apps, with which help can be called for with the click of a button. Omika Sachdeva, via email Experts Safer streets We have identified dark spots in the city and written to authorities to install streetlights there. Night patrolling has also been increased and all calls to police control room, especially reporting crimes against women are immediately attended. A night-drop facility is also available with Chandigarh police. Shruti Arora, ASP, (South), Chandigarh Awareness Women safety apps, installation of CCTV cameras, awareness regarding the safest routes to travel at night, and self-defense techniques can help ensure women\u2019s safety. Harjeet Singh, Mohali senior superintendent of police Action Police have taken every precaution to ensure that there is a check on crime rate. We have installed CCTV cameras, lights at dark spots, have made women aware. But still if any such heinous crime happens, then it is dealt at priority by police force. Any crime against woman is taken very seriously and immediate action is taken. Mamta Sodha, ACP, Panchkula Community policing Community policing is needed and each neighbourhood must hire at least a chowkidaar at night so that women feel safe. RWA members must also contribute more as the police and authorities are already doing a lot. CCTV cameras can help make neighborhoods safer. Manoj Kumar, associate professor of sociology at PGGCG- Sector 11, Chandigarh Mindset change Authorities must increase patrolling in suburban parts, where most crimes take place. However, this is a short-term fix. To tackle this problem, awareness needs to be imparted at school-level to change the mindset of people. The employers must also arrange safe transportation for women who work the night shift so that such incidents can be avoided.

        "markdown": "CRIME PREVENTION - TIPS Certain simple precautions taken up by the public can go a long way in making policing more effective and reducing crime opportunities. Some of these precautions, which can be adopted by the public, are listed below. This is not an exhaustive list but an indicative one. Fictitious offer of Funds Fictitious offer of funds to general public through letters, e-mails, mobile phones, SMSs etc. To lend credence to such offers, the communication is often sent on/from letterheads/websites that purportedly signed by top executives/senior officials of such authorities. While names of the officials might be correct but their signatures are fake. The fraudsters initially ask potential victims to deposit small sums of money for reasons, such as, processing fees/transaction fees/tax clearance charges/ conversion charges, clearing fees, etc. The victims are asked to deposit the money in a specified account in a bank. The fraudsters often have multiple accounts in the names of individuals or proprietary concerns in different bank branches for collecting such charges.

Globally, over 500,000 people are victims of this crime each year. The best protection always is prevention. Here are some tips to safeguard your good name: BEWARE Any document that has personal financial information on it can give an identity thief a foothold into your life. Put the charge slip copies in a safe spot until your credit card bills arrive. After you've reconciled your bill, shred every statement, including credit card receipts, old bank statements, medical statements, everyday bills and pre-approved credit card offers. Write clearly on all credit applications. Consistently and completely fill in all credit and loan applications using your full name, first, middle and last. Every bill that comes to your house should be addressed exactly the same. Monitor your credit accounts carefully, so you'll know if a bill's missing or unauthorised purchases have been made. Close out unused credit cards. Cutting them up is not enough. Limit the number of credit cards you carry. The fewer cards you have, the easier it is to track them. If you're moving, contact all your creditors and update them of your address changes immediately. You don't want credit information and new credit cards being delivered to the wrong address. If your credit card expires and you don't receive a new one, call your creditor immediately. Don't provide your credit card number to anyone who contacts you through telephone solicitation. Make sure any online credit card charges are handled through a secure site or in an encrypted mode. You'll know you're on a secure site if the web page on which you conduct your transaction begins with 'https' instead of the usual 'http'. Only shop on websites that offer a privacy policy. Know how your personal information will be handled. Print out privacy policies, warranties, price guarantees and other important information. Be watchful of shoulder-surfers. At ATMs and phone booths, thieves will stand close enough to see PIN numbers punched in by users."

Using Electronics - MP3 Player & Cell Phones According to the New York City Police Department, the snatching of electronic devices is on the rise across the city and in many other large cities around the world. This is due to both the increased value and ubiquity of these devices. A common element in these incidents is that the victims are not paying attention to their surroundings, distracted by the device in question. Quite often the perpetrator follows the victim from behind and snatches the electronic device right out of his or her hand. In a number of these incidents, the perpetrators were riding bicycles / mopeds when they targeted their victim. These events are not limited to the streets and have also occurred on subways and buses. To avoid being a victim: Pay attention to your surroundings, minimize the amount of time you talk on your cell phone in public places. If you suspect you are being followed, go into an open store or a and have the clerk call the Police or Public Safety right-away. Keep all electronic devices in an inside jacket pocket. Avoid clipping them onto outer garments or displaying them anywhere visible. If your cell phone is stolen, call your carrier and report the theft.

Safety Tips while using Ride Share Services like Uber & Lyft Now that the vast majority of Americans know about Uber or Lyft, millions of people count on a safe and convenient ride with just a few taps on the phone. But stories like the one about the South Carolina college student who was killed after getting into a car she mistook for an Uber raise questions about what riders can do to maximize their safety. Here are some key safety tips to help maximize your safety when using rideshare services like Uber and Lyft: Wait for your ride indoors - This prevents you from standing outside unnecessarily with a phone in your hand, signaling to passing motorists that you're waiting for someone to pick you up. Instead, wait until your driver is close or has arrived before going outside. Confirm details when the car arrives - Don't just look at what time your driver is coming. Pay attention to the make, model, and color of the car, as well as the driver's name and photo. Make sure to match the license plate number on your screen to the one you see in real life. Always ask \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d - The University of South Carolina and the family of Samantha Josephson are spearheading the campaign to promote rideshare safety by always positively identifying your driver. Never get into an Uber, Lyft or any other private car unless the driver can first identify you by name. If they\u2019re your actual driver, they will also know your destination. Map your own route during the ride - This is especially important if you're in a different city and aren't familiar with the route. By monitoring your own GPS navigation, you'll see if the driver is leading you astray. Don't share private information with your driver - This includes your personal phone number. The Uber app automatically encrypts both the driver's number and the passenger's digits to protect both sides' privacy. You should never share credit card info with the driver. All Lyft and Uber fares are paid through the app, and tips can be added there, too. Ride in the back seat - If you're the only passenger in the car, riding in the back seat gives both the passenger and driver more personal space. It also ensures you're able to get out on either side to avoid traffic. Tell a friend where you're going and who you're with - Both Lyft and Uber let you quickly and easily share who your driver is, where you're going and when you're supposed to get there. The \"share status\" option in the Uber app gives your friend your driver's name, photo, license plate and location. Your friend can then track your trip and see your estimated time of arrival -- even if he or she doesn't have the app. The \"send ETA\" feature on the Lyft app is very similar. It sends a text to your friend with details about the car, the driver and how far along you are on the route. Check out video: Home Safety Have your keys ready before you get to the door. Look back before entering your building or home. If you live in an apartment, close the lobby door behind you, especially if a stranger is approaching. Do not hold the door open for strangers. Make all visitors and delivery persons use the doorbell. When placing your name on mailboxes or on your bell, use only the last name, e.g., The Smiths. When recording an outgoing message on your answering machine, avoid leaving your name, phone number or a message that indicates you're not at home. A good message is, \"We are unable to answer the phone. Please leave a message.\" Say it confidently. Prevent Theft of Unattended Packages at Your Building There are steps you can take to help prevent theft of unattended packages from happening to you or your neighbors. Pick up packages as quickly as possible. Leaving packages in the lobby for an extended period increases the chances of theft. Most major shipping companies offer online package tracking, and some can even send you a notification when your package arrives. Utilize these and other services to avoid leaving your delivery unattended for long periods of time. Don't allow building access blindly. Verify a visitor\u2019s identity over the intercom before letting them in. Keep an eye out for suspicious activity like loitering and \"piggybacking.\" People may wait outside the building for someone to leave or enter, allowing them access to an open door. If you believe someone has entered the building on false pretenses, call Public Safety immediately. Request a signature or schedule a delivery . Many shipping companies allow you to request a specific time frame for delivery, such as an evening or weekend when you know you will be home. You can also request that the package not be left without a signature. That way, if you are not around to sign, the carrier will try delivering your package at a later date. Use a locker or other secure location. Sign up for free services such as and or use to deliver your package to a local retail store or another secure location until you are able to pick it up. The on 116th and Broadway and on 115th and Broadway will also hold packages for pickup upon request. Visit their websites to learn more. Ship your items where you have the best chance of receiving them , such as your office or place of work. Family members, trusted neighbors, or friends may be home when you are not. Consider asking them to accept packages on your behalf or hold them until you arrive. Take Crime Prevention To Work When you go to work, don't leave your crime prevention sense at home. Almost any crime that can happen at home or in your neighborhood can happen in the workplace. But common-sense prevention skills can help make life \"at work\" safer for all. Help Prevent Office Theft and Other Crimes Keep your purse, wallet, keys, or other valuable items with you always or locked in a drawer, file cabinet or closet. Don't have the key?

For more information on ID Theft or what to do if you are a victim, please go to Job / Fraudulent Check Scams Scammers know that finding a job can be tough especially now during this pandemic. To trick people looking for honest work, scammers advertise where real employers and job placement firms do. They also use to make you think that they are coming from a legitimate organization, person or even a member of the Columbia Community. They make upbeat promises about your chances of employment, and virtually all of them ask you to pay them for their services before you get the job. But the promise of a job isn\u2019t the same thing as a job. If you have to pay for the promise, it\u2019s likely a scam. In some of the reported incidents, the scammers sent to several students here at the University offering employment. \u00a0The scammer went as far as sending the victims a check (fraudulent) via priority mail or a PDF via email.\u00a0 Then then ask the victim \u00a0to deposit the check in their account and immediately start making purchases or sending money. There are many variations to this scam but all end with the same ending\u2026you deposit the check, send them the material or cash and now you get a notice from your bank that the check you deposited was fraudulent. You are now out of the money that you sent them, you are charged a bank fee for the bounced check and a negative report on your credit. Remember NO legitimate company will ask you to pay for any material or certification before giving you the job or even starting a job.

Using Electronics - MP3 Player & Cell Phones According to the New York City Police Department, the snatching of electronic devices is on the rise across the city and in many other large cities around the world. This is due to both the increased value and ubiquity of these devices. A common element in these incidents is that the victims are not paying attention to their surroundings, distracted by the device in question. Quite often the perpetrator follows the victim from behind and snatches the electronic device right out of his or her hand. In a number of these incidents, the perpetrators were riding bicycles / mopeds when they targeted their victim. These events are not limited to the streets and have also occurred on subways and buses. To avoid being a victim: Pay attention to your surroundings, minimize the amount of time you talk on your cell phone in public places. If you suspect you are being followed, go into an open store or a and have the clerk call the Police or Public Safety right-away. Keep all electronic devices in an inside jacket pocket. Avoid clipping them onto outer garments or displaying them anywhere visible. If your cell phone is stolen, call your carrier and report the theft.

Safety Tips while using Ride Share Services like Uber & Lyft Now that the vast majority of Americans know about Uber or Lyft, millions of people count on a safe and convenient ride with just a few taps on the phone. But stories like the one about the South Carolina college student who was killed after getting into a car she mistook for an Uber raise questions about what riders can do to maximize their safety. Here are some key safety tips to help maximize your safety when using rideshare services like Uber and Lyft: Wait for your ride indoors - This prevents you from standing outside unnecessarily with a phone in your hand, signaling to passing motorists that you're waiting for someone to pick you up. Instead, wait until your driver is close or has arrived before going outside. Confirm details when the car arrives - Don't just look at what time your driver is coming. Pay attention to the make, model, and color of the car, as well as the driver's name and photo. Make sure to match the license plate number on your screen to the one you see in real life. Always ask \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d - The University of South Carolina and the family of Samantha Josephson are spearheading the campaign to promote rideshare safety by always positively identifying your driver. Never get into an Uber, Lyft or any other private car unless the driver can first identify you by name. If they\u2019re your actual driver, they will also know your destination. Map your own route during the ride - This is especially important if you're in a different city and aren't familiar with the route. By monitoring your own GPS navigation, you'll see if the driver is leading you astray. Don't share private information with your driver - This includes your personal phone number. The Uber app automatically encrypts both the driver's number and the passenger's digits to protect both sides' privacy. You should never share credit card info with the driver. All Lyft and Uber fares are paid through the app, and tips can be added there, too. Ride in the back seat - If you're the only passenger in the car, riding in the back seat gives both the passenger and driver more personal space. It also ensures you're able to get out on either side to avoid traffic. Tell a friend where you're going and who you're with - Both Lyft and Uber let you quickly and easily share who your driver is, where you're going and when you're supposed to get there. The \"share status\" option in the Uber app gives your friend your driver's name, photo, license plate and location. Your friend can then track your trip and see your estimated time of arrival -- even if he or she doesn't have the app. The \"send ETA\" feature on the Lyft app is very similar. It sends a text to your friend with details about the car, the driver and how far along you are on the route. Check out video: Home Safety Have your keys ready before you get to the door. Look back before entering your building or home. If you live in an apartment, close the lobby door behind you, especially if a stranger is approaching. Do not hold the door open for strangers. Make all visitors and delivery persons use the doorbell. When placing your name on mailboxes or on your bell, use only the last name, e.g., The Smiths. When recording an outgoing message on your answering machine, avoid leaving your name, phone number or a message that indicates you're not at home. A good message is, \"We are unable to answer the phone. Please leave a message.\" Say it confidently. Prevent Theft of Unattended Packages at Your Building There are steps you can take to help prevent theft of unattended packages from happening to you or your neighbors. Pick up packages as quickly as possible. Leaving packages in the lobby for an extended period increases the chances of theft. Most major shipping companies offer online package tracking, and some can even send you a notification when your package arrives. Utilize these and other services to avoid leaving your delivery unattended for long periods of time. Don't allow building access blindly. Verify a visitor\u2019s identity over the intercom before letting them in. Keep an eye out for suspicious activity like loitering and \"piggybacking.\" People may wait outside the building for someone to leave or enter, allowing them access to an open door. If you believe someone has entered the building on false pretenses, call Public Safety immediately. Request a signature or schedule a delivery . Many shipping companies allow you to request a specific time frame for delivery, such as an evening or weekend when you know you will be home. You can also request that the package not be left without a signature. That way, if you are not around to sign, the carrier will try delivering your package at a later date. Use a locker or other secure location. Sign up for free services such as and or use to deliver your package to a local retail store or another secure location until you are able to pick it up. The on 116th and Broadway and on 115th and Broadway will also hold packages for pickup upon request. Visit their websites to learn more. Ship your items where you have the best chance of receiving them , such as your office or place of work. Family members, trusted neighbors, or friends may be home when you are not. Consider asking them to accept packages on your behalf or hold them until you arrive. Take Crime Prevention To Work When you go to work, don't leave your crime prevention sense at home. Almost any crime that can happen at home or in your neighborhood can happen in the workplace. But common-sense prevention skills can help make life \"at work\" safer for all. Help Prevent Office Theft and Other Crimes Keep your purse, wallet, keys, or other valuable items with you always or locked in a drawer, file cabinet or closet. Don't have the key? Check with your office manager to order a key. Check the identity of any strangers who are in your office or in the hallway- ask whom they are visiting and if you can help them find that person.

For more information on ID Theft or what to do if you are a victim, please go to Job / Fraudulent Check Scams Scammers know that finding a job can be tough especially now during this pandemic. To trick people looking for honest work, scammers advertise where real employers and job placement firms do. They also use to make you think that they are coming from a legitimate organization, person or even a member of the Columbia Community. They make upbeat promises about your chances of employment, and virtually all of them ask you to pay them for their services before you get the job. But the promise of a job isn\u2019t the same thing as a job. If you have to pay for the promise, it\u2019s likely a scam. In some of the reported incidents, the scammers sent to several students here at the University offering employment. \u00a0The scammer went as far as sending the victims a check (fraudulent) via priority mail or a PDF via email.\u00a0 Then then ask the victim \u00a0to deposit the check in their account and immediately start making purchases or sending money. There are many variations to this scam but all end with the same ending\u2026you deposit the check, send them the material or cash and now you get a notice from your bank that the check you deposited was fraudulent. You are now out of the money that you sent them, you are charged a bank fee for the bounced check and a negative report on your credit. Remember NO legitimate company will ask you to pay for any material or certification before giving you the job or even starting a job. While we cannot prevent , we can train ourselves to follow best practice guidelines and report suspicious activity. Do not give out personal information\u00a0via email .

This dangerous practice allows for an easy theft or a joy ride by an inexperienced driver. This commonly occurs around the neighborhood store, deli, coffee shop, or newspaper stand. Remain alert. Don't create an opportunity. Don't become a victim! When leaving your vehicle always: Close Your Windows Turn off the Ignition and REMOVE THE KEYS Lock Your Doors!

A scam includes punishment (often threats of deportation or arrest) for not acting\u00a0immediately. A scammer will keep you on the phone for a long time and will not let you hang up to call back\u00a0later. A scammer will use lots of legal-sounding language such as \u201cfederal regulations\u201d and \u201cvisa fee\u201d to sound as legitimate as\u00a0possible. Common\u00a0Scams . Do not buy gift cards for someone else per their\u00a0request.

Always be alert and aware of the people around you. Educate yourself concerning prevention tactics. Be aware of locations and situations which would make you appear vulnerable to crime, such as alleys and dark parking lots. Street Precautions Be alert to your surroundings and the people around you\u2014especially if you are alone or it is dark. Whenever possible, travel with a friend. Stay in well-lighted areas as much as possible. Walk close to the curb. Avoid doorways, bushes and alleys where someone could hide. Walk confidently at a steady pace. Make eye contact with people when walking. Do not respond to conversation from strangers on the street\u2014continue walking. If you carry a purse, carry it securely between your arm and your body. Although a purse-snatcher's intent is to steal the purse, your personal safety may depend on not clinging to it. Do not use or wear anything that will impede your vision or hearing (i.e. iPods). Car Safety Always lock your car doors after entering or leaving your vehicle. Park in well-lighted areas. Have your car keys in your hand so you don't have to linger before entering your car. Check the interior of your vehicle for intruders before entering your car. If you think you are being followed, drive to a public place or a police or sheriff station. If your car breaks down, open the hood and attach a white cloth to the car antennae. If someone stops to help, stay in your locked car and ask them to call the police, sheriff or a tow truck service. Don't stop to aid motorists by the side of the road. Make a phone call requesting help for them. While Waiting for a Bus Be alert to your surroundings and the people around you. Try to avoid isolated bus stops. Don't open your purse or wallet while boarding the bus\u2014have your pass or money already in your hand. Keep jewelry out of sight; don't flash jewelry; turn rings around so the stones don't show. On Board Buses During off hours, ride as near to the bus operator as possible If someone bothers you or makes you feel uncomfortable, change seats. Inform the driver of the situation. Carry your wallet inside your coat, or in a front pocket. Keep your belongings in front of you and hold close to your body with both hands. Be alert to pickpocketers on crowded buses; check your purse or wallet if someone is jostling, crowding or pushing you. Office Security Never leave your purse or wallet in plain view or in common accessible areas. Don't leave cash or valuables at the office. If you work alone or after business hours, keep the office door locked. If you work late, try to find another worker or a security guard to walk out with you. In an elevator, be mindful that there is a distress alarm on the control panel. Be alert for pickpocketers on crowded elevators. Report all suspicious persons and activities to the proper authorities (office manager, building security, law enforcement). Be aware of escape routes for emergencies and post the police and fire department numbers near telephones. Finally, if a crime does occur...REPORT IT! Everyone should consider it his or her responsibility to report crime. Many criminals develop favorite areas for committing crime, as well as predictable methods of operation. When you report all the facts about a crime, it helps the police assign officers in the places where crimes are occurring or where they are most likely to occur, and your report may help prevent a crime from reoccurring. At least half of the crimes in the Unites States go unreported, either because people don't think the police can do anything about it, or because people don't want to get involved. If you don't report a crime, this allows the criminal to continue to operate without interference. In many cases, it is the information provided by victims and witnesses that leads to the arrest of a criminal. So tell the police as much as you can; no fact is too trivial. The police need the eyes and ears of all citizens.

Although a purse-snatcher's intent is to steal the purse, your personal safety may depend on not clinging to it. Do not use or wear anything that will impede your vision or hearing (i.e. iPods). Car Safety Always lock your car doors after entering or leaving your vehicle. Park in well-lighted areas. Have your car keys in your hand so you don't have to linger before entering your car. Check the interior of your vehicle for intruders before entering your car. If you think you are being followed, drive to a public place or a police or sheriff station. If your car breaks down, open the hood and attach a white cloth to the car antennae. If someone stops to help, stay in your locked car and ask them to call the police, sheriff or a tow truck service. Don't stop to aid motorists by the side of the road. Make a phone call requesting help for them. While Waiting for a Bus Be alert to your surroundings and the people around you. Try to avoid isolated bus stops. Don't open your purse or wallet while boarding the bus\u2014have your pass or money already in your hand. Keep jewelry out of sight; don't flash jewelry; turn rings around so the stones don't show. On Board Buses During off hours, ride as near to the bus operator as possible If someone bothers you or makes you feel uncomfortable, change seats. Inform the driver of the situation. Carry your wallet inside your coat, or in a front pocket. Keep your belongings in front of you and hold close to your body with both hands. Be alert to pickpocketers on crowded buses; check your purse or wallet if someone is jostling, crowding or pushing you. Office Security Never leave your purse or wallet in plain view or in common accessible areas. Don't leave cash or valuables at the office. If you work alone or after business hours, keep the office door locked. If you work late, try to find another worker or a security guard to walk out with you. In an elevator, be mindful that there is a distress alarm on the control panel. Be alert for pickpocketers on crowded elevators. Report all suspicious persons and activities to the proper authorities (office manager, building security, law enforcement). Be aware of escape routes for emergencies and post the police and fire department numbers near telephones. Finally, if a crime does occur...REPORT IT! Everyone should consider it his or her responsibility to report crime. Many criminals develop favorite areas for committing crime, as well as predictable methods of operation. When you report all the facts about a crime, it helps the police assign officers in the places where crimes are occurring or where they are most likely to occur, and your report may help prevent a crime from reoccurring. At least half of the crimes in the Unites States go unreported, either because people don't think the police can do anything about it, or because people don't want to get involved. If you don't report a crime, this allows the criminal to continue to operate without interference. In many cases, it is the information provided by victims and witnesses that leads to the arrest of a criminal. So tell the police as much as you can; no fact is too trivial. The police need the eyes and ears of all citizens.

Watch where you\u2019re going and what\u2019s happening around you. \u2022 Stick to well-lit and busy streets. Walk with friends. Avoid shortcuts through a dark alley or a deserted street. If harassed by someone in a car, walk quickly or run in the opposite direction to safety. If you are really scared, scream. Never hitchhike. Accept rides only from people you know and trust. \u2022 Don\u2019t flash your cash. Always have a well-charged cell phone immediately available. Know your neighborhood. What hours are stores and restaurants open? Where are the police and fire stations, libraries, and schools? You might need them in an emergency. If you go out for a late-night snack or a midnight movie, take a friend. Don\u2019t go alone. Most assaults happen to a lone victim. Let someone know where you are going and when you will come back. Call if you\u2019re going to be late. \u2022 If you are driving, park your car in well-lit places and lock it when you leave. Check for uninvited passengers in the back seat on the floor before you get in. Have your keys in hand when approaching your car. Don\u2019t wait until you get to the car to look for your keys. Alter your routine. Change daily patterns and, if possible, take different routes to work or to school. Park in different location When jogging or bicycling: Go with a friend and take familiar and well-traveled routes. Don\u2019t jog or bike at night. Try it without your headphones. It\u2019s safer to remain alert to what\u2019s around and behind you. If you are a victim of a crime: If someone attacks you, try not to panic. Look at the attacker carefully so you can give a good description to the police. Tr y to remember important things like age, race, complexion, body build, clothing, height and weight, hair and eye color, or unusual features. Report all crimes to your local police department (PD). The closest PD to each of our locations are as follows: Main Campus \u2013 Columbus PD 614.645.4545 Delaware Location \u2013 Delaware PD 740.203.1100 Dublin Location \u2013 Dublin PD 614.889.1112 Indianapolis Location \u2013 Indianapolis Metro PD 317.327.3811 \u2022 For life-threatening emergencies call 911 If the attacker has a weapon and only wants your money or possessions, don\u2019t fight. Your life and safety are more important. If you are harassed by a gang, go to an open store, gas station, fire house, or anywhere there are people. Tips for Handling Panhandlers Be aware, alert, confident, and prepared to act. You are entitled to your space and do not have to be intimidated or harassed. Do not give money to panhandlers. Panhandling for drugs or alcohol is common. Acknowledge a panhandler with a nod, and answer the request for money by saying \u201cno.\u201d Then walk away. Don\u2019t be angry or feel guilty. Some of the ploys panhandlers use\u2026 \u201cMy wife is sick or pregnant and I need money for\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m out of gas, can you spare some change\u2026\u201d \u201cI need money for an important phone call\u2026\u201d Imagination is their only limitation. While it is not illegal to solicit people for money, anyone approached who feels threatened, annoyed, or intimidated should call the local police as soon as possible. Give a description of the panhandler, location panhandling occurred, time of occurrence, and panhandler\u2019s direction of travel when he/she left. Be willing to assist the police with prosecution if necessary. Note: If you wish to give money, have it out and ready to give. Do not go into wallets, pockets, or purses in front of panhandlers. Some people take foolish risks\u2026 \u2026and some lose. If a robber threatens you with a gun, your chance of safely disarming him/her is small. Your best protection lies in thinking ahead. What will you do if you become the victim of a hold-up? \u2022 Try to stay calm. Don\u2019t make any sudden movements to upset the robber. \u2022 Do exactly as you are told. \u2022 If you have to move or reach, tell the robber what you are going to do and why. \u2022 Try and get a good look at the robber so you can describe him/her later. \u2022 Don\u2019t be a hero. It\u2019s better to lose your money than your life. \u2022 Give the robber time to leave. \u2022 Note the direction of travel when the robber leaves. \u2022 Try and get a description of robber\u2019s vehicle ONLY if you can do so safely. Is it robbery or burglary? Burglary is the breaking and entering of your home or business with the intention of stealing or committing a felony. It isn\u2019t necessary for the theft or felony to be consummated; the crime is committed at the moment of breaking and entering. Your home or business may be burglarized but when you are personally involved you have suffered a robbery. Robbery occurs when someone steals or takes anything of value from your person or in your presence against your will, by force or violence, or puts you in fear of force or violence with the intent to deprive you of your property permanently. Cooperate with the police. You can help reduce the number of criminals on the street by: \u2022 Being available for questioning. \u2022 Answering questions factually. \u2022 Refraining from exaggerating or guessing. \u2022 Being willing to identify suspected robbers. Carjacking Strategies for Prevention: Awareness, Avoidance, and Action Violence continues to plague our society. The most recent example of senseless violence is carjacking. Carjacking is the term for a crime in which a car is taken from a person either by force or a threat of force. It is more serious than auto theft because the victim is present during the crime. Carjacking is on the rise throughout the country, but if you are aware and alert to the possible dangers, you can greatly reduce your chance of becoming a victim of this violent crime. Carjackers usually target unlocked cars with unsuspecting motorists. Citizens must be aware of their surroundings and follow preventive guidelines if they are going to reduce this crime of opportunity. Everyone is vulnerable to carjacking. Our findings show us that regardless of the time of day, location, or the type of car, everyone is at risk. Carjacking can occur while entering, driving, or exiting your vehicle. Carjacking occurs for many reasons: Anti-theft devices make parked cars more difficult to steal; the car is used to flee a crime scene or to commit other crimes; the car is sold to feed a drug habit; the carjacking is part of a gang initiation, or perpetrated just for kicks. Remember: If or when an incident occurs, only you can make a decision as to what action to take. Every situation is different and must be evaluated accordingly. Your safety is most important. The following crime prevention information on carjacking is provided for your safety and peace of mind. While driving your vehicle: Plan your route \u2013 try not to travel alone. Don\u2019t drive in unfamiliar areas, avoid trouble spots. Keep your doors locked and windows up. Look in the rearview mirror often. Observe 180 degrees around you. Be observant as you approach an area or intersection. Stay alert! Don\u2019t \u201czone out\u201d when stopped. Leave room ahead of your car in case you need to pull out to escape. If bumped from behind, motion for the other driver to follow, drive to the nearest police/fire 24 hour station, and notify the police. When stopping to use outside phones or ATMs, choose a well-lit and highly visible area. Don\u2019t stop to help stranded drivers \u2013 call the police for them. If confronted while stopped: Don\u2019t panic. Avoid verbal/physical confrontation. If pulled from your car or confronted while in your car, cooperate \u2013 move away quickly. Walk/run away from the immediate area. Call the police immediately. Give a description of your car and the suspect(s). Options to consider: Have a plan \u2013 do something, don\u2019t just sit there Park in a well-lit area. Park near a main aisle, where other cars and pedestrian traffic are nearby. Park in an outside parking lot with an attendant if possible. If you suspect something is wrong, don\u2019t stop. Always park where you have a 360-degree view around you. Be aware of your surroundings before you get out of your car. Use your auto alarm, if you have one, as a personal safety device. When confronted by a suspect or suspects, drive away with caution \u2013 usually a right turn is safest. Even if it means pulling onto a sidewalk or yard, etc. Be extra cautious when someone approaches your car and asks you for information. If you must talk to them, do so with the window up, the doors locked and be ready to drive away if necessary. Tips on Being a Good Witness Remember! A good witness answers as many of these questions as possible. Who? Who is involved? What? What are they doing? Where? Where are they doing it? When? When are they doing it? How? How are they doing it? Why? (This may be impossible to answer since you should not have any personal contact with any suspects.) Tips on identifying people: Begin by knowing exactly how tall you are. This will give you a basis for comparison. Know where the top on an automobile measures with your height, so you can judge the perpetrator\u2019s height in relation to your car. Make sure the outside of your house is adequately lit. Drug dealers, like other criminals, may like to do their business at night; lighting puts them at risk of being identified. Pay particular attention to facial hair and hair style. Rarely does a criminal change these. \u2022 Look for the color of clothes, stripes, athletic team names, numbers, and unusual designs. Does the person limp, or is there anything else unusual about his/her walk? Does the person have a speech impediment or speak with an accent? You do not have to be exact, give a little leeway. All the police need is probable cause to believe the person you are describing has committed a crime. Write it down! Keep a pad and pencil at hand. Do not compare notes with neighbors. Report the information quickly to your neighborhood Blockwatch coordinator, or local police department. This guide provides victims of identity theft with the major resources to contact. Unfortunately at this time, victims themselves are burdened with resolving the problem. It is important to act quickly and assertively to minimize the damage. In dealing with the authorities and financial institutions, keep a log of all conversations, including dates, names, and phone numbers. Note time spent and any expenses incurred. Confirm conversation in writing. Send correspondence by certified mail (return receipt requested). Keep copies of all letters and documents. Credit bureaus. Immediately call the fraud units of three reporting companies: Experian (formerly TRW), Equifax, and TransUnion (please see contact information that follows). Be aware that these measures may not entirely stop new fraudulent accounts from being opened by the imposter. Ask the credit bureaus in writing to provide you with free copies every few months so you can monitor your credit report. Ask the credit bureaus for names and phone numbers of credit grantors with whom fraudulent accounts have been opened. Ask the credit bureaus to remove inquiries that have been generated due to the fraudulent access. You may also ask the credit bureaus to notify those who have received your credit report in the last six months in order to alert them to the disputed and erroneous information (two years for employers). Creditors. Immediately contact all creditors with whom your name has been used fraudulently \u2013 by phone and in writing. Get replacement cards with new account numbers for your own accounts that have been used fraudulently. Ask that old accounts be processed as \u201caccount closed at consumer\u2019s request.\u201d This is better than \u201ccard lost or stolen,\u201d because when this statement is reported to credit bureaus, it can be interpreted as blaming you for the loss. Carefully monitor your mail and credit card bills for evidence of new fraudulent activity. Report it immediately to credit grantors. Fraud verification requirements. You may be asked by banks and credit grantors to fill out and notarize fraud affidavits, which could become costly. The law does not require you to provide a notarized affidavit. A written statement and supporting documentation should be enough (unless the creditor offers to pay for the notary). Overly burdensome requirements by creditors should be reported to federal government authorities. For help in deter mining which agency to contact, call CALPIRG or the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Law enforcement. Report the crime to all police and sheriff\u2019s departments with jurisdiction in your case. Give them as much documented evidence as possible. Get a copy of your police report. Keep the phone number of your fraud investigator handy and give it to creditors and others who require verification of your case. Credit card companies and banks may require you to show the report in order to verify the crime. Some police departments have been known to refuse to write reports on such crimes. Be persistent. Stolen checks. If you have had checks stolen or bank accounts set up fraudulently, report it back to the check verification companies. Put stop payments on any outstanding checks that you are unsure of. Cancel your checking and savings accounts and obtain new account numbers. Give the bank a secret password for your account (not mother\u2019s maiden name). ATM cards. If your ATM or debit card has been stolen or compromised, report it immediately. Get a new card, account number, and password. Do not use your old password. When creating a password, don\u2019t use common numbers like the last four digits of your Social Security Number or your birth date. Fraudulent change of address. Notify the local postal inspector if you suspect an identity thief has filed a change of your address with the post office or has used the mail to commit credit card or bank fraud. Call the local postmaster to obtain the phone number. Find out where fraudulent credit cards were sent. Notify the local postmaster for that address to forward all mail in your name to your own address. You may also need to talk with the mail carrier. Secret Service jurisdiction. The Secret Service has jurisdiction over financial fraud, but it usually does not investigate individual cases unless the dollar amount is high or you are one of many victims of a fraud ring. To interest the Secret Service in your case, you may want to ask the fraud department of the credit card companies and/or banks, as well as the police investigator, to notify the particular Secret Service agent with whom they work. Social Security Number misuse. Call the Social Security Administration (SSA) to report fraudulent use of your Social Security Number. As a last resort, you might want to try to change your number. The SSA will only change it, however, if you fit their fraud victim criteria. Also order a copy of your Earnings and Benefits Statement and check it for accuracy. Passports. If you have a passport, notify the passport office in writing to be on the lookout for anyone ordering a new passport fraudulently. Phone service. If your long-distance calling card has been stolen or you discover fraudulent charges on your bill, cancel the account and open a new one. Provide a password which must be used any time the account is changed. If your cell phone is cancelled, call your cell phone service provider to cancel service. Credit bureaus you should notify:",

Put stop payments on any outstanding checks that you are unsure of. Cancel your checking and savings accounts and obtain new account numbers. Give the bank a secret password for your account (not mother\u2019s maiden name). ATM cards. If your ATM or debit card has been stolen or compromised, report it immediately. Get a new card, account number, and password. Do not use your old password. When creating a password, don\u2019t use common numbers like the last four digits of your Social Security Number or your birth date. Fraudulent change of address. Notify the local postal inspector if you suspect an identity thief has filed a change of your address with the post office or has used the mail to commit credit card or bank fraud. Call the local postmaster to obtain the phone number. Find out where fraudulent credit cards were sent. Notify the local postmaster for that address to forward all mail in your name to your own address. You may also need to talk with the mail carrier. Secret Service jurisdiction. The Secret Service has jurisdiction over financial fraud, but it usually does not investigate individual cases unless the dollar amount is high or you are one of many victims of a fraud ring. To interest the Secret Service in your case, you may want to ask the fraud department of the credit card companies and/or banks, as well as the police investigator, to notify the particular Secret Service agent with whom they work. Social Security Number misuse. Call the Social Security Administration (SSA) to report fraudulent use of your Social Security Number. As a last resort, you might want to try to change your number. The SSA will only change it, however, if you fit their fraud victim criteria. Also order a copy of your Earnings and Benefits Statement and check it for accuracy. Passports. If you have a passport, notify the passport office in writing to be on the lookout for anyone ordering a new passport fraudulently. Phone service. If your long-distance calling card has been stolen or you discover fraudulent charges on your bill, cancel the account and open a new one. Provide a password which must be used any time the account is changed. If your cell phone is cancelled, call your cell phone service provider to cancel service. Credit bureaus you should notify:"

        "markdown": "Self-Defense Tips for Home and Away In today\u2019s day and age, you can\u2019t be too careful about who you let into your home or who you get too close to when out shopping at the mall or in another public space. The moment you let your guard down, kidnappings, abductions, and other threats could happen in an instant. Unfortunately, we have been hearing about incidences like these in our own community, and they could happen to anyone. Read through these self-defense tips, for both while you\u2019re at home and when out in public, to lower the chances of an attack. Above all, always be on guard. Protecting Yourself at Home 1. Lock Your Doors Even when you\u2019re home, it\u2019s a good idea to keep your doors locked, especially if you live in a remote location where it would be difficult to get help if a dangerous intruder did show up at your door. If you can, use peepholes or windows to see who\u2019s outside before opening your door. If you have no way of checking the doorstep without opening the door, only crack it a few inches if you\u2019re not sure who it is. 2. Close Blinds and Curtains Your home should be well-lit, both inside and out, but people shouldn\u2019t be able to see inside when it\u2019s dark outside. Get blinds or curtains that will keep anyone from seeing through them and being able to potentially track your movements or know when you\u2019re not home or sleeping. 3. Take a Self-Defense Class Anyone can benefit from taking a self-defense skills and brushing up on ways to thwart an attacker. These types of classes typically also teach participants how to evade attacks with a gun, knife, or other weapon. The Allegheny-Kiski Health Foundation occasionally hosts a free self-defense class, so be sure to keep an eye on the . 4. Get a Dog Surveys have shown that having a dog at home can deter burglaries and break-ins. If you don\u2019t already have a furry friend, consider adopting one from one of the many animals shelters in our area. Protecting Yourself Away from Home 1. Always Be Aware of Your Surroundings Never let your guard down, even when doing something as seemingly safe and secure as grocery shopping or grabbing a cup of coffee. Abductions and kidnappings can even happen in crowded, public spaces, so always be very aware of what\u2019s going on around you. If you feel like someone is following you, avoid putting yourself in a situation where he or she could easily attack you, and alert security personnel or seek help from others around you. 2. Always Fight Back Unless you are able to run away to a well-lit and well-populated area, don\u2019t give up fighting your attacker. Take any and all opportunities to injure your attacker so you can get away. Go for areas like the face, eyes, groin, and knees. If you can\u2019t use your hands to scratch, hit, or punch, use your hips to push your attacker away, then kick with your feet or knees. Self-defense instructors can demonstrate a wide range of moves you can perform to get away from someone who is trying to restrain you. However, even if you forget what you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to do, never stop trying to injure your attacker and get away to a safer location. 3. Carry Mace and Know How to Use It Mace, also called pepper spray, can be a good safety accessory to carry with you at all times. However, if you are going to carry it, you need to make sure you are comfortable with using it. Practice spraying it at home so you know how far it will spray and how close you need to be to your attacker in order for it to be effective. A few tips to keep in mind when using pepper spray are: Always spray downwind so it doesn\u2019t blow back into your face. Aim for the attacker\u2019s face. Spray two or \u00a0three times before running away. Avoid letting your attacker take the pepper spray from you and use it on you. Carry pepper spray in your hand when you feel you\u2019re in an unsafe environment. If you have to dig through your purse to find it, it\u2019s not going to do any good. 4. Trust Your Gut If you get a bad feeling about someone when you\u2019re talking with them or even if it feels like someone is walking too close behind you, trust your instincts and remove yourself from the situation. Don\u2019t worry about being perceived as rude or mean. Your safety is much more important. Search Search Recent Posts",

        "markdown": "Crime Prevention Information What is crime prevention? Crime prevention is defined as \u201cthe anticipation, the recognition, and the appraisal of a crime risk and the initiation of action to remove or reduce it.\u201d The first step in crime prevention is to realize that in order to prevent crime or becoming a crime victim we must accept that crime prevention is a shared responsibility. It is not a college problem or a police problem. It is a societal problem that can only be properly addressed by the entire campus community. On a college campus that includes, students, faculty, staff, visitors and neighbors. Therefore, campus safety is truly a shared responsibility. Three elements must be present for a crime to occur; desire, ability and opportunity. This is also known as the crime triangle. A person may \u201cwant\u201d to commit a crime, and have the \u201cability\u201d to commit a crime, but if we deny them the \u201copportunity\u201d, then no crime can be committed. Historically, the primary goal of crime prevention has been to apprehend criminals. Although this goal is still important, the goal of preventing crime and also reducing the cost of crime has taken on significant importance. Our goal is to help individuals prevent crime by helping them make decisions in their everyday lives to reduce the opportunity for crime to occur, whether on campus or not. Colleges and universities throughout the United States and the world are very concerned about providing campus settings that are safe and secure. As a result, most colleges and universities have established security and police departments that provide a wide array of security and police services and educational and prevention programs. Understanding campus crime prevention and how you can personally increase your chances of having a safe and enjoyable college experience will mutually benefit you and your campus. Know how to contact Public Safety or the police Know the emergency telephone number for your campus Public Safety (292-2911) or police department (911). Keep the emergency phone numbers near your phones (stickers, magnets, etc.). Program emergency phone numbers into your personal cell phone. Learn where the campus emergency telephones (blue light telephones) are located on campus and learn how to use them. Insure that you are subscribed to the campus mass notification system (MCC Alert). Participate in any campus emergency other safety programs being offered. Walking around campus Familiarize yourself with the layout of the campus. Survey the campus while classes are in session and after dark to see that academic buildings, walkways, facilities, and parking lots are adequately secured and well-lighted. Plan the safest route to your destination; choose well-lit, busy pathways and streets. Share your class schedule with your parents and trusted friends and give them your telephone numbers. At night, stick to well-lit areas whenever possible and avoid alleyways or \u201cshort cuts\u201d through isolated areas. Travel in groups, and avoid going out alone at night. Use the campus escort service at night. Know where the emergency call boxes are located on campus and learn how to use them. If you are being followed, change direction and go to the nearest business or home; knock on the door, and request that someone call the police. Note the description of the person following you. Walk near the curb and avoid shrubbery or other places of potential concealment. Tell a friend or roommate where you are going and what time you expect to return. Stay alert to your surroundings and the people around you. Carry your purse close to your body and keep a firm grip on it; carry your wallet in an inside coat pocket or your front pant pocket. Keep your keys separate from your purse or backpack. Don\u2019t overload yourself with bags or packages and avoid wearing shoes that restrict your movements. Walk with a confident stride; keep your head up and look around. If a motorist stops and asks for directions, keep your distance from the car. In the residence halls Always lock your door; even when you\u2019re sleeping or just going down the hall. Do not allow strangers to enter your room or your complex. Do not open your door unless you can identify the person seeking entry. Do not let unknown individuals \u201ctailgate\u201d; ask who they are visiting and offer to call Public Safety. Do not prop any exterior doors open to allow unescorted visitors into the residence hall (pizza delivery, friends, etc.). Report lost or stolen residence hall keys immediately to your residence hall staff. Report any malfunctioning locks, doors or windows to your Residence Life staff. Do not leave your keys lying around in your room when you are not in the room. Do not leave messages on your door about when you will be returning to your room. Tell a roommate or friend if you are planning to be away overnight or for a few days. Report any suspicious persons or activities (including solicitors) in or near your residence hall to your residence hall staff, Public Safety or police. Secure your valuables and engrave expensive items with identifying information. Always lock your doors and windows at night, especially if you reside on the first or second floors. Do not leave your identification, keys, wallets, checkbooks, or other valuables in open view. Get to know your RA, Residence Life staff and neighbors. Motor vehicle safety Park in well lighted areas, where your vehicle is visible; avoid parking next to vans or trucks. Keep all items out of sight, especially valuables. Service your vehicle regularly to avoid breakdowns. Keep your vehicle locked at all times. When leaving your car for service, remove your other keys. Have your key ready when you approach your car. Before getting in, check inside and under your car to make sure no one is hiding. Bicycle safety and protection Use a bike light when riding a bicycle at night. Wear a helmet at all times when riding a bicycle. Obey all traffic laws; you must stop at intersections; pedestrians have the right of way. Pay attention to your surroundings; warn pedestrians when you are passing them. Take extra care when passing parking lot exits or driving through parking lots. Give proper hand signals when turning or stopping. Before leaving a lane, give a hand signal. Leave the lane only when safe to do so. Secure your bicycle with a heavy duty U-lock or chain. When possible, lock at least your front wheel and frame to a bike rack or other stationary object. Do not park your bicycle in a doorway, on stairs, or blocking any handicapped access. Use a bike rack. Engrave or permanently mark your bicycle with an identifying number and record that number with Public Safety or the police. On Foot Avoid dark, vacant, or deserted areas; use well-lit routes. Avoid walking/jogging/running alone, especially at night. Ask a friend to go with you. Call Public Safety to accompany you around campus during evening hours. Dress in clothes and shoes that will not hamper movement. Be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times. Avoid wearing headsets that impair your ability to detect and respond to potentially dangerous situations. Report suspicious activity or noises immediately. Carry a noise-making device with you at all times, and use it if you suspect you are in danger. Move to a lit area or building and raise a commotion. Call 911 or activate a blue light emergency phone in the event of an emergency. If you sense trouble: Move away from the potential threat if possible; cross the street and increase your pace. Join a group of people nearby. If a threatening situation is imminent and people are close by, yell, scream or do whatever you can to get their attention. Remember, dialing 911 and or/activating a fire alarm are both part of the personal safety system. 911 calls are free from most pay phones, and blue light emergency phones are usually located in many areas on campus and simply require a push of a button to notify emergency services of your situation. If you are facing an armed criminal, you may minimize the risk of injury to yourself if you comply with the criminal's demands. However, if your life is in immediate danger, use any defense you can to get away. Dial 911 immediately and give a description of the suspect Automatic teller machines Try to use ATMs during daylight hours. If you must go at night, do not go alone. Avoid ATMs that are not well lit or clearly visible from the street. Be aware of people loitering or sitting in cars around ATMs. Prepare your transaction ahead of time. Do not spend much time at the machine. Do not give out your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to anyone! Many thieves will attempt to steal your PIN number by calling you on the phone and claiming they are the police, security officers, or bank officers. Memorize it and do not keep a written copy of it in your wallet. Either keep your ATM receipt or tear it up and throw it away. Protecting yourself from identity theft Destroy private records and statements. Destroy credit card statements, solicitations and other documents that contain any private information. Shred this paperwork using a \"cross-cut\" shredder so thieves can't find your data when they rummage through your garbage. Also, don't leave a paper trail; never leave ATM, credit card or gas station receipts behind. Secure your mail. Empty your mailbox quickly, lock it or get a P.O. Box so criminals don't have a chance to steal credit card offers. Never mail outgoing bill payments and checks from an unsecured mailbox, especially at home. They can be stolen from your mailbox and the payee's name erased with solvents. Mail them from the post office or another secure location. Safeguard your Social Security number. Never carry your card with you, or any other card that may have your number, like a health insurance card or school issued ID. Don't put your number on your checks; your SSN is the primary target for identity thieves because it gives them access to your credit report and bank accounts. There are very few entities that can actually demand your SSN - the Department of Motor Vehicles, for example. Also, SSNs are required for transactions involving taxes, so that means banks, brokerages, employers, and the like also have a legitimate need for your SSN. Safeguard your computer. Protect your computer from viruses and spies. Use complicated passwords; frequently update antivirus software and spyware. Surf the Web cautiously. Shop only at trustworthy web sites and be wary of obscure sites or any site you've never used before. Know who you're dealing with. Whenever you are contacted, either by phone or email, by individuals identifying themselves as banks, credit card or e-commerce companies and asked for private identity or financial information, do not respond. Legitimate companies do not contact you and ask you to provide personal data such as PINs, user names and passwords or bank account information over the phone or Internet. If you think the request is legitimate, contact the company yourself by calling customer service using the number on your account statement or in the telephone book and confirm what you were told before revealing any of your personal data. Take your name off marketers' hit lists. In addition to the national Do Not Call Registry (1-888-382-1222 or ), you also can reduce credit card solicitations for five years by contacting an opt-out service run by the three major credit bureaus: (888) 5-OPT OUT or . You'll need to provide your Social Security number as an identifier. Guard your personal information. Ask questions whenever anyone asks you for personal data. How will the information be used? Why must I provide this data? Ask anyone who does require your Social Security number, for instance, cell phone providers, what their privacy policy is and whether you can arrange for the organization not to share your information with anyone else. Monitor your credit report. Each year, obtain and thoroughly review your credit report from the three major credit bureaus; Equifax (800-685-1111), Experian (883-397-3742) and TransUnion (800-680-4213) or at ) to look for suspicious activity. If you spot something, alert your card company or the creditor immediately. Review your bank and credit card statements carefully. Look for unauthorized charges or withdrawals and report them immediately. Make sure you recognize the merchants, locations and purchases listed before paying the bill. If you don't need or use department store or bank-issued credit cards, consider closing the accounts. Keep track of your billing dates/cycles and follow up with creditors if you don\u2019t receive bills/statements on time. Use random letters and numbers for passwords; don\u2019t use your mother\u2019s maiden name, your birth date, your graduation date, your social security number or any other familiar letters or numbers that can be associated with you as passwords. Be aware of how ID thieves can get your information. They get information from businesses or other institutions by stealing records, bribing employees with access to records, hacking into computers, rummaging through trash, posing as a landlord, employer, or someone else who may have a legal right to the information, stealing credit and debit card numbers as your card is processed by using a special information storage device (\"skimming\"), stealing wallets and purses containing identification and credit or bank cards, stealing mail, including bank and credit card statements, pre-approved credit offers, new checks, or tax information or completing a \"change of address form\" to divert your mail to another location. If your identity is stolen: Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus. Tell them that you're an identity theft victim. Request that a \"fraud alert\" be placed in your file, along with a victim's statement asking that creditors call you before opening any new accounts or changing your existing accounts. Equifax To report fraud: 1-800-525-6285 (P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241), Experian To report fraud: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742) (P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013), and TransUnion To report fraud: 1-800-680-7289 (Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92634) Contact the creditors for any accounts that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. Speak with someone in the security/fraud department of each creditor, and follow up with a letter. If your Social Security number has been used illegally, contact the Social Security Fraud Hotline at 1-800-269-0271. File a report with Public Safety or the police in the community where the identity theft took place. Get a copy of the police report in case the bank, credit-card company, or others need proof of the crime. Keep records of everything involved in your efforts to clear up fraud, including copies of written correspondence and records of telephone calls. Computer scams Computer phishing is a crime. Phishers attempt to fraudulently acquire credit card details and other sensitive personal data via bogus email or pop-up windows. It may look like a legitimate email from a legitimate institution, but beware of unsolicited requests for information. Financial or payment institutions will never request that you send them personal sensitive data via email or pop up windows. If you receive a suspicious looking email from any bank, lending, or payment institution, it is best to delete and not respond. If, by coincidence, you have an account with the entity mentioned in the email, call your legitimate institution using the number on your physical bill or via the telephone book or through telephone information. Do not call the number that may be listed in the bogus email and do not click on any link listed in the bogus email Using public transportation Try to avoid isolated bus or train stops and times when few people are around. Stay away from the curb until bus/train arrives. Have the exact fare or ticket/pass ready as you board the bus. If possible, sit near the driver and notify him or her of any problems. A crowded bus is a prime target for pick pockets; carry your bags close and carry your wallet in your coat or front pant pocket. If someone is bothering or harassing you, move to another seat location and/or tell the person in a loud voice to \u201cSTAY AWAY\u201d. Don\u2019t fall asleep on a bus or shuttle. Remain on the bus/train if you are uncomfortable with getting off. Theft protection When leaving your dorm room, home, or office, lock doors and windows even if you will be gone for \"just a minute.\" Never leave your purse, wallet, or valuables exposed; store them out of sight. Be especially careful with your credit cards, which are very popular items among thieves because they are usually easy to steal and then use again. Consider obtaining a credit card with your photo imprinted on it. Computers, especially if they are portable, are primary targets of theft. Consider the purchase of a locking security or tracking device. Contact Public Safety to borrow engravers; engrave computers, stereos, and televisions with your driver's license number (including home state) or department name. Do not engrave on removable serial number plates. Keep a list of all items and serial numbers in a safe place. Never prop open a locked door. Vandalism and graffiti Report all vandalism and graffiti immediately. In addition to being illegal and costly, much vandalism and graffiti may also be bias, hate or gang related. Safety at work If you\u2019re working late, let someone know where you are and how long you expect to be; or better yet, plan in advance to have a co-worker stay with you. Keep your purse or wallet locked in a drawer or filing cabinet at all times. Politely ask strangers who they are visiting and offer to help find the person; if you are suspicious of the person contact Public Safety or the police. Keep emergency phone numbers posted near your phone. Know your office emergency evacuation plan. Be cautious if using restrooms, elevators or stairwells that are isolated or poorly lit; or go with a friend. Keep money, checkbooks, or other valuable items out of sight. Report any suspicious, threatening or alarming behavior of others to your supervisor or Public Safety/police immediately. Do not loan your office keys to anyone and report lost or stolen keys immediately to your supervisor and the security/police department. Active Threat (Workplace/Campus Violence) If you are involved in a situation where someone has entered the area and started shooting; the following are a list of actions that are recommended: If possible exit the building/area immediately, but only if it can be done safely. Notify anyone you may encounter to exit the building immediately. Notify Public Safety or police if safe to use phone. Give the following information: Your name Your phone number Location of the incident (be as specific as possible) Number of shooters Identification of shooter Number of persons who may be involved Your location If exiting the building/area is not possible, the following actions are recommended: Go to the nearest room or office. Close and lock the door. If unable to lock the door, use a wedge device or heavy furniture to block the door; a belt or other objects may be able to wedge the door shut. Cover the door windows. Depending upon the shooters location, exit out the window quietly and quickly if possible and safe to do so. Stay low, move away from the door, keep quiet and act as if no one is in the room. Do not answer the door. Notify Public Safety or police. Provide information as needed. Wait for the police to assist your exit from the building: Follow all instructions by police officers Police may not know if the shooter is hiding among you, therefore police may search you and your belongings for everyone's safety. If you are trapped with the shooter, you need to decide whether to: Stay still and play dead. Run for an exit, or Attack the shooter. Online safety Never give personal information to people that you don\u2019t know (name, home address, phone number, etc.). If you decide to talk to someone on the phone don\u2019t give out your number; call them and use caller ID block. Use a nickname in chat rooms or message boards. Meet chat friends in public places and with other friends; take a cell phone with you. Never go to someone\u2019s room, apartment or house that you just met. Holiday security If you leave campus during school holidays store your bicycle with Student Housing. If you leave your car on campus find out where you are supposed to park it and remove all valuables from it. Place valuables that you cannot take with you out of sight in your room/apartment/home and unplug all appliances before you leave. Park your car in a well-lit location and leave your keys and contact information with a trusted friend. If you stay on campus during holidays or the summer be alert to any suspicious persons around the residence halls, bike racks, or parking lots. Call Public Safety or the Police immediately to report any unusual activity. Studying or traveling abroad Gain as much information as possible about the county that you will be traveling to. Visit (Inoculation Requirements) Check your medical health insurance coverage. Make two extra copies of all your travel information (passport, airline tickets, etc.); leave one set at home with a relative or close friend and take a copy with you. Know your credit card limits. Make certain that a trusted family member is aware of the location of all your legal papers; legal will, insurance documents, mortgage information, internet/cell phone passwords, etc. Leave valuable or expensive looking jewelry at home. Do not bring large amounts of cash; use traveler\u2019s checks or credit cards. Take a list of all important telephone numbers (family, U.S. Embassy and Consulate, campus emergency numbers). When you arrive, secure a copy of your important information in a safe and secure location. Bring an extra pair of prescription glasses. Pack your medical prescriptions in their original containers. Mark all luggage on the inside and outside with your name, address and telephone number; if possible cover your outside luggage tags.",

Historically, the primary goal of crime prevention has been to apprehend criminals. Although this goal is still important, the goal of preventing crime and also reducing the cost of crime has taken on significant importance. Our goal is to help individuals prevent crime by helping them make decisions in their everyday lives to reduce the opportunity for crime to occur, whether on campus or not. Colleges and universities throughout the United States and the world are very concerned about providing campus settings that are safe and secure. As a result, most colleges and universities have established security and police departments that provide a wide array of security and police services and educational and prevention programs. Understanding campus crime prevention and how you can personally increase your chances of having a safe and enjoyable college experience will mutually benefit you and your campus. Know how to contact Public Safety or the police Know the emergency telephone number for your campus Public Safety (292-2911) or police department (911). Keep the emergency phone numbers near your phones (stickers, magnets, etc.). Program emergency phone numbers into your personal cell phone. Learn where the campus emergency telephones (blue light telephones) are located on campus and learn how to use them. Insure that you are subscribed to the campus mass notification system (MCC Alert). Participate in any campus emergency other safety programs being offered. Walking around campus Familiarize yourself with the layout of the campus. Survey the campus while classes are in session and after dark to see that academic buildings, walkways, facilities, and parking lots are adequately secured and well-lighted. Plan the safest route to your destination; choose well-lit, busy pathways and streets. Share your class schedule with your parents and trusted friends and give them your telephone numbers. At night, stick to well-lit areas whenever possible and avoid alleyways or \u201cshort cuts\u201d through isolated areas. Travel in groups, and avoid going out alone at night. Use the campus escort service at night. Know where the emergency call boxes are located on campus and learn how to use them. If you are being followed, change direction and go to the nearest business or home; knock on the door, and request that someone call the police. Note the description of the person following you. Walk near the curb and avoid shrubbery or other places of potential concealment. Tell a friend or roommate where you are going and what time you expect to return. Stay alert to your surroundings and the people around you. Carry your purse close to your body and keep a firm grip on it; carry your wallet in an inside coat pocket or your front pant pocket. Keep your keys separate from your purse or backpack. Don\u2019t overload yourself with bags or packages and avoid wearing shoes that restrict your movements. Walk with a confident stride; keep your head up and look around. If a motorist stops and asks for directions, keep your distance from the car. In the residence halls Always lock your door; even when you\u2019re sleeping or just going down the hall. Do not allow strangers to enter your room or your complex. Do not open your door unless you can identify the person seeking entry. Do not let unknown individuals \u201ctailgate\u201d; ask who they are visiting and offer to call Public Safety. Do not prop any exterior doors open to allow unescorted visitors into the residence hall (pizza delivery, friends, etc.). Report lost or stolen residence hall keys immediately to your residence hall staff. Report any malfunctioning locks, doors or windows to your Residence Life staff. Do not leave your keys lying around in your room when you are not in the room. Do not leave messages on your door about when you will be returning to your room. Tell a roommate or friend if you are planning to be away overnight or for a few days. Report any suspicious persons or activities (including solicitors) in or near your residence hall to your residence hall staff, Public Safety or police. Secure your valuables and engrave expensive items with identifying information. Always lock your doors and windows at night, especially if you reside on the first or second floors. Do not leave your identification, keys, wallets, checkbooks, or other valuables in open view. Get to know your RA, Residence Life staff and neighbors. Motor vehicle safety Park in well lighted areas, where your vehicle is visible; avoid parking next to vans or trucks. Keep all items out of sight, especially valuables. Service your vehicle regularly to avoid breakdowns. Keep your vehicle locked at all times. When leaving your car for service, remove your other keys. Have your key ready when you approach your car. Before getting in, check inside and under your car to make sure no one is hiding. Bicycle safety and protection Use a bike light when riding a bicycle at night. Wear a helmet at all times when riding a bicycle. Obey all traffic laws; you must stop at intersections; pedestrians have the right of way. Pay attention to your surroundings; warn pedestrians when you are passing them. Take extra care when passing parking lot exits or driving through parking lots. Give proper hand signals when turning or stopping. Before leaving a lane, give a hand signal. Leave the lane only when safe to do so. Secure your bicycle with a heavy duty U-lock or chain. When possible, lock at least your front wheel and frame to a bike rack or other stationary object. Do not park your bicycle in a doorway, on stairs, or blocking any handicapped access. Use a bike rack. Engrave or permanently mark your bicycle with an identifying number and record that number with Public Safety or the police. On Foot Avoid dark, vacant, or deserted areas; use well-lit routes. Avoid walking/jogging/running alone, especially at night. Ask a friend to go with you. Call Public Safety to accompany you around campus during evening hours. Dress in clothes and shoes that will not hamper movement. Be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times. Avoid wearing headsets that impair your ability to detect and respond to potentially dangerous situations. Report suspicious activity or noises immediately. Carry a noise-making device with you at all times, and use it if you suspect you are in danger. Move to a lit area or building and raise a commotion. Call 911 or activate a blue light emergency phone in the event of an emergency. If you sense trouble: Move away from the potential threat if possible; cross the street and increase your pace. Join a group of people nearby. If a threatening situation is imminent and people are close by, yell, scream or do whatever you can to get their attention. Remember, dialing 911 and or/activating a fire alarm are both part of the personal safety system. 911 calls are free from most pay phones, and blue light emergency phones are usually located in many areas on campus and simply require a push of a button to notify emergency services of your situation. If you are facing an armed criminal, you may minimize the risk of injury to yourself if you comply with the criminal's demands. However, if your life is in immediate danger, use any defense you can to get away. Dial 911 immediately and give a description of the suspect Automatic teller machines Try to use ATMs during daylight hours. If you must go at night, do not go alone. Avoid ATMs that are not well lit or clearly visible from the street. Be aware of people loitering or sitting in cars around ATMs. Prepare your transaction ahead of time. Do not spend much time at the machine. Do not give out your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to anyone! Many thieves will attempt to steal your PIN number by calling you on the phone and claiming they are the police, security officers, or bank officers. Memorize it and do not keep a written copy of it in your wallet. Either keep your ATM receipt or tear it up and throw it away. Protecting yourself from identity theft Destroy private records and statements. Destroy credit card statements, solicitations and other documents that contain any private information. Shred this paperwork using a \"cross-cut\" shredder so thieves can't find your data when they rummage through your garbage. Also, don't leave a paper trail; never leave ATM, credit card or gas station receipts behind. Secure your mail. Empty your mailbox quickly, lock it or get a P.O. Box so criminals don't have a chance to steal credit card offers. Never mail outgoing bill payments and checks from an unsecured mailbox, especially at home. They can be stolen from your mailbox and the payee's name erased with solvents. Mail them from the post office or another secure location. Safeguard your Social Security number. Never carry your card with you, or any other card that may have your number, like a health insurance card or school issued ID. Don't put your number on your checks; your SSN is the primary target for identity thieves because it gives them access to your credit report and bank accounts. There are very few entities that can actually demand your SSN - the Department of Motor Vehicles, for example. Also, SSNs are required for transactions involving taxes, so that means banks, brokerages, employers, and the like also have a legitimate need for your SSN. Safeguard your computer. Protect your computer from viruses and spies. Use complicated passwords; frequently update antivirus software and spyware. Surf the Web cautiously. Shop only at trustworthy web sites and be wary of obscure sites or any site you've never used before. Know who you're dealing with. Whenever you are contacted, either by phone or email, by individuals identifying themselves as banks, credit card or e-commerce companies and asked for private identity or financial information, do not respond. Legitimate companies do not contact you and ask you to provide personal data such as PINs, user names and passwords or bank account information over the phone or Internet. If you think the request is legitimate, contact the company yourself by calling customer service using the number on your account statement or in the telephone book and confirm what you were told before revealing any of your personal data. Take your name off marketers' hit lists. In addition to the national Do Not Call Registry (1-888-382-1222 or ), you also can reduce credit card solicitations for five years by contacting an opt-out service run by the three major credit bureaus: (888) 5-OPT OUT or . You'll need to provide your Social Security number as an identifier. Guard your personal information. Ask questions whenever anyone asks you for personal data. How will the information be used? Why must I provide this data? Ask anyone who does require your Social Security number, for instance, cell phone providers, what their privacy policy is and whether you can arrange for the organization not to share your information with anyone else. Monitor your credit report. Each year, obtain and thoroughly review your credit report from the three major credit bureaus; Equifax (800-685-1111), Experian (883-397-3742) and TransUnion (800-680-4213) or at ) to look for suspicious activity. If you spot something, alert your card company or the creditor immediately. Review your bank and credit card statements carefully. Look for unauthorized charges or withdrawals and report them immediately. Make sure you recognize the merchants, locations and purchases listed before paying the bill. If you don't need or use department store or bank-issued credit cards, consider closing the accounts. Keep track of your billing dates/cycles and follow up with creditors if you don\u2019t receive bills/statements on time. Use random letters and numbers for passwords; don\u2019t use your mother\u2019s maiden name, your birth date, your graduation date, your social security number or any other familiar letters or numbers that can be associated with you as passwords. Be aware of how ID thieves can get your information. They get information from businesses or other institutions by stealing records, bribing employees with access to records, hacking into computers, rummaging through trash, posing as a landlord, employer, or someone else who may have a legal right to the information, stealing credit and debit card numbers as your card is processed by using a special information storage device (\"skimming\"), stealing wallets and purses containing identification and credit or bank cards, stealing mail, including bank and credit card statements, pre-approved credit offers, new checks, or tax information or completing a \"change of address form\" to divert your mail to another location. If your identity is stolen: Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus. Tell them that you're an identity theft victim. Request that a \"fraud alert\" be placed in your file, along with a victim's statement asking that creditors call you before opening any new accounts or changing your existing accounts. Equifax To report fraud: 1-800-525-6285 (P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241), Experian To report fraud: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742) (P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013), and TransUnion To report fraud: 1-800-680-7289 (Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92634) Contact the creditors for any accounts that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. Speak with someone in the security/fraud department of each creditor, and follow up with a letter. If your Social Security number has been used illegally, contact the Social Security Fraud Hotline at 1-800-269-0271. File a report with Public Safety or the police in the community where the identity theft took place. Get a copy of the police report in case the bank, credit-card company, or others need proof of the crime. Keep records of everything involved in your efforts to clear up fraud, including copies of written correspondence and records of telephone calls. Computer scams Computer phishing is a crime. Phishers attempt to fraudulently acquire credit card details and other sensitive personal data via bogus email or pop-up windows. It may look like a legitimate email from a legitimate institution, but beware of unsolicited requests for information. Financial or payment institutions will never request that you send them personal sensitive data via email or pop up windows. If you receive a suspicious looking email from any bank, lending, or payment institution, it is best to delete and not respond. If, by coincidence, you have an account with the entity mentioned in the email, call your legitimate institution using the number on your physical bill or via the telephone book or through telephone information. Do not call the number that may be listed in the bogus email and do not click on any link listed in the bogus email Using public transportation Try to avoid isolated bus or train stops and times when few people are around. Stay away from the curb until bus/train arrives. Have the exact fare or ticket/pass ready as you board the bus. If possible, sit near the driver and notify him or her of any problems. A crowded bus is a prime target for pick pockets; carry your bags close and carry your wallet in your coat or front pant pocket. If someone is bothering or harassing you, move to another seat location and/or tell the person in a loud voice to \u201cSTAY AWAY\u201d. Don\u2019t fall asleep on a bus or shuttle. Remain on the bus/train if you are uncomfortable with getting off. Theft protection When leaving your dorm room, home, or office, lock doors and windows even if you will be gone for \"just a minute.\" Never leave your purse, wallet, or valuables exposed; store them out of sight. Be especially careful with your credit cards, which are very popular items among thieves because they are usually easy to steal and then use again. Consider obtaining a credit card with your photo imprinted on it. Computers, especially if they are portable, are primary targets of theft. Consider the purchase of a locking security or tracking device. Contact Public Safety to borrow engravers; engrave computers, stereos, and televisions with your driver's license number (including home state) or department name. Do not engrave on removable serial number plates. Keep a list of all items and serial numbers in a safe place. Never prop open a locked door. Vandalism and graffiti Report all vandalism and graffiti immediately. In addition to being illegal and costly, much vandalism and graffiti may also be bias, hate or gang related. Safety at work If you\u2019re working late, let someone know where you are and how long you expect to be; or better yet, plan in advance to have a co-worker stay with you. Keep your purse or wallet locked in a drawer or filing cabinet at all times. Politely ask strangers who they are visiting and offer to help find the person; if you are suspicious of the person contact Public Safety or the police. Keep emergency phone numbers posted near your phone. Know your office emergency evacuation plan. Be cautious if using restrooms, elevators or stairwells that are isolated or poorly lit; or go with a friend. Keep money, checkbooks, or other valuable items out of sight. Report any suspicious, threatening or alarming behavior of others to your supervisor or Public Safety/police immediately. Do not loan your office keys to anyone and report lost or stolen keys immediately to your supervisor and the security/police department. Active Threat (Workplace/Campus Violence) If you are involved in a situation where someone has entered the area and started shooting; the following are a list of actions that are recommended: If possible exit the building/area immediately, but only if it can be done safely. Notify anyone you may encounter to exit the building immediately. Notify Public Safety or police if safe to use phone. Give the following information: Your name Your phone number Location of the incident (be as specific as possible) Number of shooters Identification of shooter Number of persons who may be involved Your location If exiting the building/area is not possible, the following actions are recommended: Go to the nearest room or office. Close and lock the door. If unable to lock the door, use a wedge device or heavy furniture to block the door; a belt or other objects may be able to wedge the door shut. Cover the door windows. Depending upon the shooters location, exit out the window quietly and quickly if possible and safe to do so. Stay low, move away from the door, keep quiet and act as if no one is in the room. Do not answer the door. Notify Public Safety or police. Provide information as needed. Wait for the police to assist your exit from the building: Follow all instructions by police officers Police may not know if the shooter is hiding among you, therefore police may search you and your belongings for everyone's safety. If you are trapped with the shooter, you need to decide whether to: Stay still and play dead. Run for an exit, or Attack the shooter. Online safety Never give personal information to people that you don\u2019t know (name, home address, phone number, etc.). If you decide to talk to someone on the phone don\u2019t give out your number; call them and use caller ID block. Use a nickname in chat rooms or message boards. Meet chat friends in public places and with other friends; take a cell phone with you. Never go to someone\u2019s room, apartment or house that you just met. Holiday security If you leave campus during school holidays store your bicycle with Student Housing. If you leave your car on campus find out where you are supposed to park it and remove all valuables from it. Place valuables that you cannot take with you out of sight in your room/apartment/home and unplug all appliances before you leave. Park your car in a well-lit location and leave your keys and contact information with a trusted friend. If you stay on campus during holidays or the summer be alert to any suspicious persons around the residence halls, bike racks, or parking lots. Call Public Safety or the Police immediately to report any unusual activity. Studying or traveling abroad Gain as much information as possible about the county that you will be traveling to. Visit (Inoculation Requirements) Check your medical health insurance coverage. Make two extra copies of all your travel information (passport, airline tickets, etc.); leave one set at home with a relative or close friend and take a copy with you. Know your credit card limits. Make certain that a trusted family member is aware of the location of all your legal papers; legal will, insurance documents, mortgage information, internet/cell phone passwords, etc. Leave valuable or expensive looking jewelry at home. Do not bring large amounts of cash; use traveler\u2019s checks or credit cards. Take a list of all important telephone numbers (family, U.S. Embassy and Consulate, campus emergency numbers). When you arrive, secure a copy of your important information in a safe and secure location. Bring an extra pair of prescription glasses. Pack your medical prescriptions in their original containers. Mark all luggage on the inside and outside with your name, address and telephone number; if possible cover your outside luggage tags."

        "markdown": "Author : Published on May 16, 2024 Crime in India: A Critical Review of Data Collection and Analysis Safe countries bestow multiple social and economic benefits on the individual and larger community. Therefore, crime levels must be controlled. While India is a relatively peaceful country by global standards, there is significant scope for improvement in terms of policing, the national criminal justice system, and how data on crimes is collected and analysed. Amid India\u2019s rapid urbanisation, it is crucial to study the various facets of criminality from the city perspective to foster safe and productive environments.

Introduction Countries that are peaceful, orderly, and have a safe environment enable their communities to enjoy a sense of security about life and livelihood. Safe countries allow individuals to participate in leisure and productive activities without fear, accruing substantial social and economic benefits for the state. Industry, commerce, and businesses typically prefer to be located in areas with low crime rates and, consequently, low costs associated with criminal activities (such as insurance premiums and losses from theft or damage). Conversely, violent crimes such as murders, rapes, grievous hurt, and robberies have significant impacts on society\u2014an economic impact on survivors, their families (especially in instances of death), and the community and country due to the emotional and physical toll. Communities suffer the consequences of lower property values, higher insurance premiums, and reduced investment in high-crime areas. Apart from incurring economic losses due to lower productivity, the state also spends more on the criminal justice system (policing, operations, investigations, courts and prisons). India established the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in 1986, a national system for collecting and collating crime statistics. It provides a fair degree of information on crime, the nature of crime, and crime rates in the country. Given the enormous size of the Indian population and its socioeconomic evolutions, India has a comparatively low crime rate by global standards and its unique context. Even so, India\u2014and indeed all other countries\u2014must closely monitor crime trends and rates as the criminal world is dynamic and constantly engineering new forms of wrongdoing. Tackling such activities requires robust and agile policies based on extensive data. This brief presents an overview of crime in India, particularly in urban areas, based on the annual report prepared by the NCRB titled Crime in India . The latest edition was published in 2023 (pertaining to 2022). This comprehensive database is immensely valuable for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, researchers, and citizens to understand the nature, volume, and dynamics of crime in India. Understanding the NCRB Data Among the vast volume of data presented in its reports, the NCRB provides separate statistics on specific wrongdoings that are considered cognisable crimes as per the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The NCRB also takes cognisance of cases under special and local laws, tabulating these separately. This brief is focused on serious crimes and not the latter set of delinquencies, which may be milder in nature. The NCRB report also includes a dataset on crimes in states and union territories, and a similar set on crimes in 19 metropolitan cities with populations over two million \u2014Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Kanpur, Kochi, Kolkata, Kozhikode, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Pune, and Surat. Such bifurcated data enables an assessment of crime in states and crime in urban or rural areas. The NCRB also provides crime rates for each head (type) of crime. Crime rate is the ratio between the number of crimes recorded and the population in a given area. Globally, the crime rate typically refers to an instance of a particular crime per 100,000 people. If the number of such instances is added, larger geographical entities with higher demography will produce more crimes than the smaller ones. However, the crime rate is a proportioned measuring tool, enabling an assessment and comparison of different statistics across countries and regions. The NCRB collects and presents data on only cognisable crimes, not non-cognisable offences. The first schedule of the Criminal Procedure Code classifies IPC-related crimes into cognisable and non-cognisable offences: cognisable cases are those where a police officer may arrest without a warrant, while non-cognisable cases are those where a police officer shall not arrest without a warrant. In essence, cognisable crimes are those on which the police can act (making an arrest or beginning an investigation) even without a court order. These include offences such as murder, attempt to murder, rape, and theft. On the other hand, non-cognisable crimes are not actionable by the police and must be pursued by the affected parties in the courts. Examples of such crimes are assault, cheating, forgery, and defamation. To assess how crime has evolved in India over the years, this brief studies the NCRB reports of 1953, 1963, 1973, 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013, and 2023, enabling a 70-year overview. India\u2019s population has grown substantially, from 36.1 crore in 1951 to 120.01 crore in 2011. Although India has not conducted a census since 2011, the NCRB used other sources to estimate India\u2019s population as 137.97 crore in its 2023 report. This brief studies nine specific serious crimes: murder, kidnapping and abduction, offences against public tranquillity, crimes against women, crimes against children, crimes against senior citizens, property offences, economic offences, and cybercrime. Although the NCRB has collected and presented data since its inception, the early reports contained sketchy statistics. Over the years, data quality has improved\u2014both in the extent of data collected (across more districts and states) and how it is collected, collated, and analysed, especially with greater technology integration. A notable point in how the NCRB defines\u2014and thus collects, collates, and assesses data\u2014is its use of the \u2018principal offence\u2019 rule when classifying crimes. The rule stipulates that if multiple offences are registered under a single first information report (FIR) case, only the most heinous crime is counted as a unit. This effectively means that other lesser crimes bundled with the most serious ones are not reflected in the NCRB statistics. Observations in the 1953 Report The 1953 NCRB report, the first edition of the Crime in India report, provides insights into the changes that occurred following India\u2019s independence with regard to tackling crime. The 1953 report records that as economic conditions improved in independent India, the police were able to devote more time to enforcing law and order, leading to a decline in the annual volume of crime in the country, from 6.54 lakh cases in 1949 to 6.01 lakh cases in 1953 (a 7.95 percent reduction). However, criminal activities recorded at that time appear to be more \u2018traditional\u2019 in nature and were recorded under only a few heads: murder, kidnapping and abduction, dacoity, robbery, breaking into a house, theft, and rioting. Notably, the report also detailed several handicaps in police work\u2014the lowest number of policepersons per 100,000 population compared to advanced countries, a drop in the quality of recruitment, and a decline in fear of the police among criminals. Additionally, the quality of the police system was poor on account of archaic methods of investigation, lack of forensic science laboratories, poor medico-legal examination, and case disposal delays in the courts. The report suggested quality recruitment, tighter laws, establishing more forensic science labs, and better capacity in medical jurisprudence. Analysing the Data Cognisable crimes in India rose 9.67 times between 1953 and 2023, from about 0.6 million to about 5.8 million, while the population grew 3.82 times during the same period (see Table 1). Notably, the crime rate more than doubled during this period, from 160 in 1953 to 422.2 in 2023. Data for the years between 1972 and 2023 reveals that while India\u2019s population increased by 2.45 times, the volume of crime increased by 3.62 times and the crime rate by 1.47 times. The crime rates for the decades between 1953 and 1993 appear stable. However, the years between the 1993-2003 and 2003-2013 periods show a sharp rise in the crime rate, with the two decades appearing as the most crime-infested in the country. The situation seems to have improved between 2013 and 2023, with a drop in the crime rate, from a high of 540.4 in 2013 to 422.2 in 2023. Table 1: Crime in India |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year | Total Cognisable Crimes | Population (Million) | Crime Rate |\n| 1953 | 6,01,964 | 361.0 | 160 |\n| 1963 | 6,58,830 | 458.9 | 143.5 |\n| 1973 | 10,77,181 | 573.4 | 187.9 |\n| 1983 | 13,49,866 | 720.4 | 187.4 |\n| 1993 | 54,33,574 | 883.8 | 184.4 |\n| 2003 | 54,94,814 | 1,068.2 | 514.4 |\n| 2013 | 66,40,378 | 1,228.7 | 540.4 |\n| 2023 | 58,24,946 | 1,379.7 | 422.2 | Source: NCRB Annual Reports A general inference from the NCRB reports is that crime has risen faster than India\u2019s population has grown, resulting in a higher crime rate. However, a deeper data analysis indicates several potential explanatory factors for the rise. First, the basket of cognisable crimes has widened over the years as newer crimes, such as economic offences, are now included alongside the traditional ones. In 1973, the NCRB collected data for murder, rape, kidnapping and abduction, dacoity, robbery, burglary, thefts, riots, criminal breach of trust, cheating, counterfeiting and others. By 2023, in addition to the traditional types of crimes, it also collected data on deaths by negligence (especially road accidents), dowry deaths, acid attacks, assault on women, sexual harassment, offences relating to religion, economic offences, and cyber-crimes, among others. Additionally, the progressive introduction of technology and improved access (in terms of transportation and means of communication) has led to better collection and reporting due to improved transportation. Another potential cause for India\u2019s increased crime rate is socioeconomic factors such as poverty, unemployment, and the rampant consumption of alcohol and drugs. Global research has established that poverty tends to aggravate illegal activities, and unemployment results in financial difficulty and reduces social integration, thereby making the unemployed more susceptible to crime. Similarly, inequality breeds resentment because of the uneven distribution of resources and may drive criminal behaviour in some individuals. Understanding these relationships is critical for crafting holistic and effective crime prevention strategies. Equally important is concentrated action to eliminate poverty, unemployment, and inequality. In India, research has found links between crime and income inequality, poverty rate, \u00a0low literacy rate, macroeconomic factors such as gross state domestic product per capita, and demographic factors such as population density. Urban crime in India Conducting a historical analysis of crime in Indian cities is somewhat challenging since the 1953 report did not include any urban-specific data. This was perhaps because of the low level of urbanisation at that point (17.3 percent), with over 80 percent of the national population living in villages. Although the 1963 report included separate data on cities, it was only for eight million-plus cities: Ahmedabad, Bangalore (Bengaluru), Bombay (Mumbai), Calcutta (Kolkata), Delhi, Hyderabad, Kanpur, and Madras (Chennai). The 1973 report included separate data for the same eight cities. However, the 1983 report contained data for four more cities (Jaipur, Lucknow, Nagpur, and Pune). The 1993 report included a chapter on urban crimes for the first time. The chapter was essentially a trend analysis of metropolitan cities and noted that the number of cities with populations exceeding one million had increased from 12 to 23 by 1991. The 2003 report recorded that the number of million-plus cities had risen to 35 by 2001, and the 2013 report shows a further increase to 53. However, during the decade between 2013 and 2023, the process of reporting crimes in urban areas was revamped, with 19 metropolitan cities with populations above two million being recorded. Many of these cities are urban agglomerations; Kozhikode, Coimbatore, Kochi, Ghaziabad, and Patna have populations under two million (as per the 2011 Census) but cross that mark as urban agglomerations when the larger urbanised area around their municipal limits is considered. Notably, there is a vast difference in the population sizes of the 19 metropolitan regions now being recorded in the NCRB report. While Kozhikode, Kochi, and Coimbatore have populations of 2.03 million, 2.11 million, and 2.15 million, respectively, Kolkata, Delhi, and Mumbai have populations of 14.1 million, 16.3 million, and 18.4 million, respectively. This diversity in population numbers renders data comparison somewhat incongruous. However, it is possible to provide a general overview of crime in cities and how this compares with the rest of the country, affording some insights on comparative crime rates, the nature of crime, and contrasts in criminal behaviour across the country (see Table 2). Table 2: Crime in Indian Cities |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year (Number of Cities) | Total Cog Crimes | Population Percentage | Crime Rate | National Crime Rate |\n| 1993 (23) | 2,33,374 | 8.7 | 303.1 | 184.4 |\n| 2003 (35) | 2,91,246 | 10 | 270 | 160.7 |\n| 2013 (53) | 5,56,024 | 13.3 | 345.9 | 215.5 |\n| 2023 (19) | 6,20,356 | 8.12 | 553.70 | 258.1 | Source: NCRB Annual Reports As Table 2 illustrates, the total number of cognisable crimes in metropolitan cities has increased, especially in the last two decades (2003-2023). It can also be inferred that the share of such crimes in the cities under assessment is higher than the share of their population. According to the 2023 report, the 19 metropolitan cities are home to 8.12 percent of India\u2019s population but report 14.65 percent of all cognisable crimes. This also means that crime rates in large cities substantially exceed the national crime rate average. This corroborates the widely acknowledged finding by criminologists that crime rates are in larger cities than in smaller towns and villages, and that cities are more prone to crime. This is perhaps due to the greater opportunity to commit crimes on account of wider access to wealth, and the lower probability of recognition, detection, and arrest. Global experiences corroborate this fact. For instance, the crime victimisation rate in the US in 2021 was 24.5 for urban and 11.1 for rural areas. Additionally, the number of violent crimes in urban areas is rising across the US. Similarly, in the European Union, people living in cities across the 27 member states report three times more crime than those in rural areas. However, a more detailed look at city-wise data in India indicates that not all 19 metropolitan areas showcase the same patterns. According to the data in the 2023 report, the cities of Jaipur, Indore, Kochi, Patna, Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Nagpur, and Lucknow exceed the average crime rate of their states. However, Kolkata, Chennai, Coimbatore, Pune, Hyderabad, and Kozhikode have lower crime rates than their state average. As such, the NCRB data indicates two key points: the theory that urban centres have a greater propensity towards crime is not entirely true for all the 19 metropolitan regions recorded, while the assertion that larger cities have a higher crime rate than smaller ones holds in India. According to the 2023 report, Delhi exceeds all other cities studied in terms of the crime rate, at 1832.6, which is 3.36 times the national city average of 544. Jaipur (916.7), Indore (767.7), Kochi (626.7), and Patna (611.7) have the next highest crime rates. Kolkata is the most peaceful city, with a low crime rate of 78.2. Additionally, Chennai (211.2), Coimbatore (211.2), Surat (215.3), Pune (219.3), Hyderabad (266.7), Bengaluru (337.3), Ahmedabad (360.1), Mumbai (367.3), Kozhikode (397.5), Kanpur (401.4), Ghaziabad (418.0), Nagpur (516), and Lucknow (521) have crime rates lower than the national city average. The murder rate was highest in Patna (5.2 per lakh population), followed by Lucknow (4.5), Jaipur (4.3), Indore (3.3), and Ghaziabad (3.1). Kolkata (0.2), Kozhikode (0.3), Mumbai (0.7), and Kochi (0.8) have less than one murder per lakh population. As a percentage, the 19 urban agglomerations accounted for 7.12 percent of all nationwide murders, lower than their total average population percentage (8.12). The rate of kidnapping and abduction was highest in Delhi (34.2), followed by Patna (32.4), and Indore (31.1). Chennai (0.4), Coimbatore (0.4), and Kochi (0.9) had the lowest rates of kidnapping and abduction per lakh population. The 19 cities recorded higher kidnapping and abduction rates as a percentage of their population than the rest of the country (12.99 percent). Crime rates against women were the highest in Jaipur (239.3), Delhi (186.9), and Lucknow (161.4). According to the 2023 report, gender crime increased by over 12.3 percent over 2021. A total of 48,755 cases were registered in 2022; this figure was 43,414 in 2021. Coimbatore (12.9), Chennai (17.1) and Kolkata (27.8) emerged as the most women-friendly cities. Delhi recorded the most crimes against children (7,400), followed by Mumbai (3178) and Bengaluru (1578), while Coimbatore (83), Patna (127) and Kochi (206) were at the bottom of the list. Additionally, 3,996 cases of crimes against senior citizens were registered in the 19 cities, with Delhi (1313), Mumbai (572), and Bengaluru (458) accounting for the most cases, while Patna, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, and Kanpur had no recorded cases. In the area of economic offences, 40,760 cases were registered in the 19 metropolitan cities, a jump of 15.8 percent over 2021. Of these, 88.4 percent of cases were of forgery, cheating, and fraud, with the 19 cities responsible for 21.07 percent of all such cases recorded countrywide. Additionally, the 19 cities recorded 37.06 percent of all cybercrimes in India, with a total of 24,420 cases registered. Table 3 illustrates the number of crimes in the 19 Indian cities compared with the rest of the country (as per the 2023 NCRB report). While the population percentage of the reported cities was 8.12 percent, every major crime, except murder and offences against public tranquillity, was higher than the population percentage. The figures on property-related offences could explain why there are more gated communities in large cities nationwide. Table 3: MAJOR CRIMES IN INDIA AND CITIES (2023) |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRIME | ALL INDIA | CITIES | CITY PERCENT |\n| Murder | 28,522 | 2,031 | 7.12 |\n| Kidnapping and Abduction | 1,07,588 | 13,984 | 12.99 |\n| Offences Against Public Tranquillity | 57,082 | 3,457 | 6.05 |\n| Crime Against Women | 4,45,256 | 48,755 | 10.94 |\n| Crime Against Children | 1,62,449 | 20,550 | 12.65 |\n| Crime Against Senior Citizens | 28,545 | 3,996 | 13.99 |\n| Economic Offences | 1,93,385 | 40,760 | 21.07 |\n| Cybercrime | 65,893 | 24,420 | 37.06 |\n| Offences Against Property | 8,39,252 | 2,76,830 | 32.98 | Source: NCRB Annual Reports Notably, the performance of India\u2019s criminal justice system was found to be lacking. The conviction rate for major heinous crimes was poor: for murder, it was 42.5 percent; for rape, 17.9 percent; and for kidnapping and abduction, it was 38.6 percent. The Need for Better Data While the NCRB data is the most comprehensive set of statistics in India, it has some deficits that should be rectified. Firstly, the NCRB data is entirely secondary, a mere collection of statistics on crime as supplied by the State Crime Records Bureaus. The NCRB does not independently verify any data by conducting its own research. For instance, the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (the country\u2019s primary statistical agency) conducts an annual \u2018National Crime Victimization Survey\u2019 covering around 150,000 households. The NCRB does not undertake any such survey. Consequently, data reliability is a pressing issue. Secondly, not all crimes are reported. Criminologists have stated that people\u2019s reporting behaviour impacts crime statistics in India. They also suggest that higher literacy rates lead to higher reporting. The state-wise literacy rate in 2023, based on the National Statistical Office Survey, varied from 66.4 percent (Andhra Pradesh) to 96.2 percent (Kerala). This is not captured in India\u2019s crime statistics, leading to distortions and erroneous inter-state comparisons. Thirdly, in some instances, police officers are known to practice what is called the \u2018burking of crime,\u2019 a term indicating the practice of not registering an FIR on a crime, which allows the local police to present a better picture of crime rates (essentially, lower rates) in their jurisdiction. Fourthly, the NCRB follows the \u2018principal offence rule\u2019. This means that if there is a combination of offences in a single FIR, such as murder and rape, the offence that is recorded is the more heinous crime (in this case, murder) These factors reduce the total volume of reported crime, especially since there is no cross-verification mechanism to check field data. These factors need to be examined closely to establish a reworked system that allows for a more comprehensive and accurate reporting of crime. Notably, the NCRB states that the gravity or nature of the crime does not receive any weightage and that all crimes are treated equally. This may lead to unfair conclusions about the safety of a state or a city where the volume of petty crime is higher than another state or city where the number of total crimes is comparatively low, but the number of grave crimes is high. Another area for improvement is the unavailability of data on all urban areas in the country. Capturing data on all urban areas will require an enormous effort. A starting point is to collect and compile the data generated by the 71 police commissionerates across the country that have been established over the years in the larger urban areas. Later, data collection could be expanded to cities with populations above one lakh and other smaller cities in stages. Furthermore, the nature of crime is evolving; newer kinds of crime are emerging, and more laws are being enacted, resulting in more heads of crime under which data is collected.\u00a0 More research must be conducted on the causes of crime in India. As the country urbanises, the nature and complexity of crime will likely evolve while the instances of crime increase. The NCRB, therefore, must continuously examine how it collects and organises crime data. Conclusion While crime rates in India are rising, it is still a reasonably peaceful country. According to one assessment of crime rates by country (2024), India ranks 79th among 197 countries. According to the Global Organized Crime Index, a tool to measure levels of organised crime in a country, India ranks 61st among 193 countries. Still, India must maintain a constant vigil to achieve and maintain a low level of crime across the country. Given the linkages between crime and poverty, unemployment, and inequality, the country must focus on significantly curbing or eliminating such weaknesses in the domestic socioeconomic profile. Notably, given the dynamics of urban crime and since India is set to urbanise rapidly in the coming years, greater stress on addressing crime in cities is needed. The NCRB analysis is wanting on this front, and more needs to be done in urban crime analysis beyond mere data collection. For instance, some areas that require further study are the criminal behaviour of different sets of people, and migratory populations and whether they have a propensity towards particular crimes. Additionally, the country must also consider ways to improve the quality of policing and reforming processes in the criminal justice system for the faster closure of cases. Finally, the NCRB must seek to improve data reliability by undertaking a nationwide crime victimisation survey that will lend greater authenticity to crime statistics collected nationwide. Endnotes The NCRB is an official organ of the Ministry of Home Affairs and is India\u2019s storehouse of information on crimes and criminals. As a government entity, the NCRB is well positioned to access information from the State Records Bureaus, District Records Bureaus, and police commissionerates in metropolitan cities. Unlike the laws in the penal code that apply to the entire country, special and local laws are made to handle criminal activities in a specific state or area of a state. They address the unique needs, customs, and cultural practices that are issues within that state or area. The NCRB report uses the population and area of urban agglomerations larger than the municipal limits of the cities for its assessments. As such, for Delhi, it considers the entire National Capital Region (which includes neighbouring such as Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Noida). While some urban agglomerations only marginally satisfy the two million criteria, others have large populations (some even upwards of 20 million). The decennial Census was scheduled to be conducted in 2021 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCRB has used the following sources to estimate India\u2019s population in 2022: the report of the technical group on population projections (July 2020), under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\u2019s National Commission on Population (estimates are based on the 2011 Census). However, for the 19 metropolitan cities, it uses the actual population as per the 2011 Census. A written document prepared by the police when they receive information about a cognisable offence. Crime victimisation is a survey process in which individual citizens voluntarily disclose if they have been the targets of criminal acts. The rate is calculated as total victimisations per 1000 persons. Assessing 2021 data alongside 2022 data (as presented in the NCRB\u2019s 2023 report) allows a direct comparison, as the number of cities reported on and the format of reporting were the same for both years. It also shows the sharp increase in crime against women, necessitating a more concerted attempt to take remedial steps. This is the propensity of a person to report a crime that has been committed.

Therefore, crime levels must be controlled. While India is a relatively peaceful country by global standards, there is significant scope for improvement in terms of policing, the national criminal justice system, and how data on crimes is collected and analysed. Amid India\u2019s rapid urbanisation, it is crucial to study the various facets of criminality from the city perspective to foster safe and productive environments. Attribution: Ramanath Jha, \u201cCrime in India: A Critical Review of Data Collection and Analysis,\u201d ORF Issue Brief No. 710 , May 2024, Observer Research Foundation. Introduction Countries that are peaceful, orderly, and have a safe environment enable their communities to enjoy a sense of security about life and livelihood. Safe countries allow individuals to participate in leisure and productive activities without fear, accruing substantial social and economic benefits for the state. Industry, commerce, and businesses typically prefer to be located in areas with low crime rates and, consequently, low costs associated with criminal activities (such as insurance premiums and losses from theft or damage). Conversely, violent crimes such as murders, rapes, grievous hurt, and robberies have significant impacts on society\u2014an economic impact on survivors, their families (especially in instances of death), and the community and country due to the emotional and physical toll. Communities suffer the consequences of lower property values, higher insurance premiums, and reduced investment in high-crime areas. Apart from incurring economic losses due to lower productivity, the state also spends more on the criminal justice system (policing, operations, investigations, courts and prisons). India established the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in 1986, a national system for collecting and collating crime statistics. It provides a fair degree of information on crime, the nature of crime, and crime rates in the country. Given the enormous size of the Indian population and its socioeconomic evolutions, India has a comparatively low crime rate by global standards and its unique context. Even so, India\u2014and indeed all other countries\u2014must closely monitor crime trends and rates as the criminal world is dynamic and constantly engineering new forms of wrongdoing. Tackling such activities requires robust and agile policies based on extensive data. This brief presents an overview of crime in India, particularly in urban areas, based on the annual report prepared by the NCRB titled Crime in India . The latest edition was published in 2023 (pertaining to 2022). This comprehensive database is immensely valuable for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, researchers, and citizens to understand the nature, volume, and dynamics of crime in India. Understanding the NCRB Data Among the vast volume of data presented in its reports, the NCRB provides separate statistics on specific wrongdoings that are considered cognisable crimes as per the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The NCRB also takes cognisance of cases under special and local laws, tabulating these separately. This brief is focused on serious crimes and not the latter set of delinquencies, which may be milder in nature. The NCRB report also includes a dataset on crimes in states and union territories, and a similar set on crimes in 19 metropolitan cities with populations over two million \u2014Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Kanpur, Kochi, Kolkata, Kozhikode, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Pune, and Surat. Such bifurcated data enables an assessment of crime in states and crime in urban or rural areas. The NCRB also provides crime rates for each head (type) of crime. Crime rate is the ratio between the number of crimes recorded and the population in a given area. Globally, the crime rate typically refers to an instance of a particular crime per 100,000 people. If the number of such instances is added, larger geographical entities with higher demography will produce more crimes than the smaller ones. However, the crime rate is a proportioned measuring tool, enabling an assessment and comparison of different statistics across countries and regions. The NCRB collects and presents data on only cognisable crimes, not non-cognisable offences. The first schedule of the Criminal Procedure Code classifies IPC-related crimes into cognisable and non-cognisable offences: cognisable cases are those where a police officer may arrest without a warrant, while non-cognisable cases are those where a police officer shall not arrest without a warrant. In essence, cognisable crimes are those on which the police can act (making an arrest or beginning an investigation) even without a court order. These include offences such as murder, attempt to murder, rape, and theft. On the other hand, non-cognisable crimes are not actionable by the police and must be pursued by the affected parties in the courts. Examples of such crimes are assault, cheating, forgery, and defamation. To assess how crime has evolved in India over the years, this brief studies the NCRB reports of 1953, 1963, 1973, 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013, and 2023, enabling a 70-year overview. India\u2019s population has grown substantially, from 36.1 crore in 1951 to 120.01 crore in 2011. Although India has not conducted a census since 2011, the NCRB used other sources to estimate India\u2019s population as 137.97 crore in its 2023 report. This brief studies nine specific serious crimes: murder, kidnapping and abduction, offences against public tranquillity, crimes against women, crimes against children, crimes against senior citizens, property offences, economic offences, and cybercrime. Although the NCRB has collected and presented data since its inception, the early reports contained sketchy statistics. Over the years, data quality has improved\u2014both in the extent of data collected (across more districts and states) and how it is collected, collated, and analysed, especially with greater technology integration. A notable point in how the NCRB defines\u2014and thus collects, collates, and assesses data\u2014is its use of the \u2018principal offence\u2019 rule when classifying crimes. The rule stipulates that if multiple offences are registered under a single first information report (FIR) case, only the most heinous crime is counted as a unit. This effectively means that other lesser crimes bundled with the most serious ones are not reflected in the NCRB statistics. Observations in the 1953 Report The 1953 NCRB report, the first edition of the Crime in India report, provides insights into the changes that occurred following India\u2019s independence with regard to tackling crime. The 1953 report records that as economic conditions improved in independent India, the police were able to devote more time to enforcing law and order, leading to a decline in the annual volume of crime in the country, from 6.54 lakh cases in 1949 to 6.01 lakh cases in 1953 (a 7.95 percent reduction). However, criminal activities recorded at that time appear to be more \u2018traditional\u2019 in nature and were recorded under only a few heads: murder, kidnapping and abduction, dacoity, robbery, breaking into a house, theft, and rioting. Notably, the report also detailed several handicaps in police work\u2014the lowest number of policepersons per 100,000 population compared to advanced countries, a drop in the quality of recruitment, and a decline in fear of the police among criminals. Additionally, the quality of the police system was poor on account of archaic methods of investigation, lack of forensic science laboratories, poor medico-legal examination, and case disposal delays in the courts. The report suggested quality recruitment, tighter laws, establishing more forensic science labs, and better capacity in medical jurisprudence. Analysing the Data Cognisable crimes in India rose 9.67 times between 1953 and 2023, from about 0.6 million to about 5.8 million, while the population grew 3.82 times during the same period (see Table 1). Notably, the crime rate more than doubled during this period, from 160 in 1953 to 422.2 in 2023. Data for the years between 1972 and 2023 reveals that while India\u2019s population increased by 2.45 times, the volume of crime increased by 3.62 times and the crime rate by 1.47 times. The crime rates for the decades between 1953 and 1993 appear stable. However, the years between the 1993-2003 and 2003-2013 periods show a sharp rise in the crime rate, with the two decades appearing as the most crime-infested in the country. The situation seems to have improved between 2013 and 2023, with a drop in the crime rate, from a high of 540.4 in 2013 to 422.2 in 2023. Table 1: Crime in India Year Total Cognisable Crimes Population (Million) Crime Rate 1953 6,01,964 361.0 160 1963 6,58,830 458.9 143.5 1973 10,77,181 573.4 187.9 1983 13,49,866 720.4 187.4 1993 54,33,574 883.8 184.4 2003 54,94,814 1,068.2 514.4 2013 66,40,378 1,228.7 540.4 2023 58,24,946 1,379.7 422.2 Source: NCRB Annual Reports A general inference from the NCRB reports is that crime has risen faster than India\u2019s population has grown, resulting in a higher crime rate. However, a deeper data analysis indicates several potential explanatory factors for the rise. First, the basket of cognisable crimes has widened over the years as newer crimes, such as economic offences, are now included alongside the traditional ones. In 1973, the NCRB collected data for murder, rape, kidnapping and abduction, dacoity, robbery, burglary, thefts, riots, criminal breach of trust, cheating, counterfeiting and others. By 2023, in addition to the traditional types of crimes, it also collected data on deaths by negligence (especially road accidents), dowry deaths, acid attacks, assault on women, sexual harassment, offences relating to religion, economic offences, and cyber-crimes, among others. Additionally, the progressive introduction of technology and improved access (in terms of transportation and means of communication) has led to better collection and reporting due to improved transportation. Another potential cause for India\u2019s increased crime rate is socioeconomic factors such as poverty, unemployment, and the rampant consumption of alcohol and drugs. Global research has established that poverty tends to aggravate illegal activities, and unemployment results in financial difficulty and reduces social integration, thereby making the unemployed more susceptible to crime. Similarly, inequality breeds resentment because of the uneven distribution of resources and may drive criminal behaviour in some individuals. Understanding these relationships is critical for crafting holistic and effective crime prevention strategies. Equally important is concentrated action to eliminate poverty, unemployment, and inequality. In India, research has found links between crime and income inequality, poverty rate, \u00a0low literacy rate, macroeconomic factors such as gross state domestic product per capita, and demographic factors such as population density. Urban crime in India Conducting a historical analysis of crime in Indian cities is somewhat challenging since the 1953 report did not include any urban-specific data. This was perhaps because of the low level of urbanisation at that point (17.3 percent), with over 80 percent of the national population living in villages. Although the 1963 report included separate data on cities, it was only for eight million-plus cities: Ahmedabad, Bangalore (Bengaluru), Bombay (Mumbai), Calcutta (Kolkata), Delhi, Hyderabad, Kanpur, and Madras (Chennai). The 1973 report included separate data for the same eight cities. However, the 1983 report contained data for four more cities (Jaipur, Lucknow, Nagpur, and Pune). The 1993 report included a chapter on urban crimes for the first time. The chapter was essentially a trend analysis of metropolitan cities and noted that the number of cities with populations exceeding one million had increased from 12 to 23 by 1991. The 2003 report recorded that the number of million-plus cities had risen to 35 by 2001, and the 2013 report shows a further increase to 53. However, during the decade between 2013 and 2023, the process of reporting crimes in urban areas was revamped, with 19 metropolitan cities with populations above two million being recorded. Many of these cities are urban agglomerations; Kozhikode, Coimbatore, Kochi, Ghaziabad, and Patna have populations under two million (as per the 2011 Census) but cross that mark as urban agglomerations when the larger urbanised area around their municipal limits is considered. Notably, there is a vast difference in the population sizes of the 19 metropolitan regions now being recorded in the NCRB report. While Kozhikode, Kochi, and Coimbatore have populations of 2.03 million, 2.11 million, and 2.15 million, respectively, Kolkata, Delhi, and Mumbai have populations of 14.1 million, 16.3 million, and 18.4 million, respectively. This diversity in population numbers renders data comparison somewhat incongruous. However, it is possible to provide a general overview of crime in cities and how this compares with the rest of the country, affording some insights on comparative crime rates, the nature of crime, and contrasts in criminal behaviour across the country (see Table 2). Table 2: Crime in Indian Cities Year (Number of Cities) Total Cog Crimes Population Percentage Crime Rate National Crime Rate 1993 (23) 2,33,374 8.7 303.1 184.4 2003 (35) 2,91,246 10 270 160.7 2013 (53) 5,56,024 13.3 345.9 215.5 2023 (19) 6,20,356 8.12 553.70 258.1 Source: NCRB Annual Reports As Table 2 illustrates, the total number of cognisable crimes in metropolitan cities has increased, especially in the last two decades (2003-2023). It can also be inferred that the share of such crimes in the cities under assessment is higher than the share of their population. According to the 2023 report, the 19 metropolitan cities are home to 8.12 percent of India\u2019s population but report 14.65 percent of all cognisable crimes. This also means that crime rates in large cities substantially exceed the national crime rate average. This corroborates the widely acknowledged finding by criminologists that crime rates are in larger cities than in smaller towns and villages, and that cities are more prone to crime. This is perhaps due to the greater opportunity to commit crimes on account of wider access to wealth, and the lower probability of recognition, detection, and arrest. Global experiences corroborate this fact. For instance, the crime victimisation rate in the US in 2021 was 24.5 for urban and 11.1 for rural areas. Additionally, the number of violent crimes in urban areas is rising across the US. Similarly, in the European Union, people living in cities across the 27 member states report three times more crime than those in rural areas. However, a more detailed look at city-wise data in India indicates that not all 19 metropolitan areas showcase the same patterns. According to the data in the 2023 report, the cities of Jaipur, Indore, Kochi, Patna, Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Nagpur, and Lucknow exceed the average crime rate of their states. However, Kolkata, Chennai, Coimbatore, Pune, Hyderabad, and Kozhikode have lower crime rates than their state average. As such, the NCRB data indicates two key points: the theory that urban centres have a greater propensity towards crime is not entirely true for all the 19 metropolitan regions recorded, while the assertion that larger cities have a higher crime rate than smaller ones holds in India. According to the 2023 report, Delhi exceeds all other cities studied in terms of the crime rate, at 1832.6, which is 3.36 times the national city average of 544. Jaipur (916.7), Indore (767.7), Kochi (626.7), and Patna (611.7) have the next highest crime rates. Kolkata is the most peaceful city, with a low crime rate of 78.2. Additionally, Chennai (211.2), Coimbatore (211.2), Surat (215.3), Pune (219.3), Hyderabad (266.7), Bengaluru (337.3), Ahmedabad (360.1), Mumbai (367.3), Kozhikode (397.5), Kanpur (401.4), Ghaziabad (418.0), Nagpur (516), and Lucknow (521) have crime rates lower than the national city average. The murder rate was highest in Patna (5.2 per lakh population), followed by Lucknow (4.5), Jaipur (4.3), Indore (3.3), and Ghaziabad (3.1). Kolkata (0.2), Kozhikode (0.3), Mumbai (0.7), and Kochi (0.8) have less than one murder per lakh population. As a percentage, the 19 urban agglomerations accounted for 7.12 percent of all nationwide murders, lower than their total average population percentage (8.12). The rate of kidnapping and abduction was highest in Delhi (34.2), followed by Patna (32.4), and Indore (31.1). Chennai (0.4), Coimbatore (0.4), and Kochi (0.9) had the lowest rates of kidnapping and abduction per lakh population. The 19 cities recorded higher kidnapping and abduction rates as a percentage of their population than the rest of the country (12.99 percent). Crime rates against women were the highest in Jaipur (239.3), Delhi (186.9), and Lucknow (161.4). According to the 2023 report, gender crime increased by over 12.3 percent over 2021. A total of 48,755 cases were registered in 2022; this figure was 43,414 in 2021. Coimbatore (12.9), Chennai (17.1) and Kolkata (27.8) emerged as the most women-friendly cities. Delhi recorded the most crimes against children (7,400), followed by Mumbai (3178) and Bengaluru (1578), while Coimbatore (83), Patna (127) and Kochi (206) were at the bottom of the list. Additionally, 3,996 cases of crimes against senior citizens were registered in the 19 cities, with Delhi (1313), Mumbai (572), and Bengaluru (458) accounting for the most cases, while Patna, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, and Kanpur had no recorded cases. In the area of economic offences, 40,760 cases were registered in the 19 metropolitan cities, a jump of 15.8 percent over 2021. Of these, 88.4 percent of cases were of forgery, cheating, and fraud, with the 19 cities responsible for 21.07 percent of all such cases recorded countrywide. Additionally, the 19 cities recorded 37.06 percent of all cybercrimes in India, with a total of 24,420 cases registered. Table 3 illustrates the number of crimes in the 19 Indian cities compared with the rest of the country (as per the 2023 NCRB report). While the population percentage of the reported cities was 8.12 percent, every major crime, except murder and offences against public tranquillity, was higher than the population percentage. The figures on property-related offences could explain why there are more gated communities in large cities nationwide. Table 3: MAJOR CRIMES IN INDIA AND CITIES (2023) CRIME ALL INDIA CITIES CITY PERCENT Murder 28,522 2,031 7.12 Kidnapping and Abduction 1,07,588 13,984 12.99 Offences Against Public Tranquillity 57,082 3,457 6.05 Crime Against Women 4,45,256 48,755 10.94 Crime Against Children 1,62,449 20,550 12.65 Crime Against Senior Citizens 28,545 3,996 13.99 Economic Offences 1,93,385 40,760 21.07 Cybercrime 65,893 24,420 37.06 Offences Against Property 8,39,252 2,76,830 32.98 Source: NCRB Annual Reports Notably, the performance of India\u2019s criminal justice system was found to be lacking. The conviction rate for major heinous crimes was poor: for murder, it was 42.5 percent; for rape, 17.9 percent; and for kidnapping and abduction, it was 38.6 percent. The Need for Better Data While the NCRB data is the most comprehensive set of statistics in India, it has some deficits that should be rectified. Firstly, the NCRB data is entirely secondary, a mere collection of statistics on crime as supplied by the State Crime Records Bureaus. The NCRB does not independently verify any data by conducting its own research. For instance, the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (the country\u2019s primary statistical agency) conducts an annual \u2018National Crime Victimization Survey\u2019 covering around 150,000 households. The NCRB does not undertake any such survey. Consequently, data reliability is a pressing issue. Secondly, not all crimes are reported. Criminologists have stated that people\u2019s reporting behaviour impacts crime statistics in India. They also suggest that higher literacy rates lead to higher reporting. The state-wise literacy rate in 2023, based on the National Statistical Office Survey, varied from 66.4 percent (Andhra Pradesh) to 96.2 percent (Kerala). This is not captured in India\u2019s crime statistics, leading to distortions and erroneous inter-state comparisons. Thirdly, in some instances, police officers are known to practice what is called the \u2018burking of crime,\u2019 a term indicating the practice of not registering an FIR on a crime, which allows the local police to present a better picture of crime rates (essentially, lower rates) in their jurisdiction. Fourthly, the NCRB follows the \u2018principal offence rule\u2019. This means that if there is a combination of offences in a single FIR, such as murder and rape, the offence that is recorded is the more heinous crime (in this case, murder) These factors reduce the total volume of reported crime, especially since there is no cross-verification mechanism to check field data. These factors need to be examined closely to establish a reworked system that allows for a more comprehensive and accurate reporting of crime. Notably, the NCRB states that the gravity or nature of the crime does not receive any weightage and that all crimes are treated equally. This may lead to unfair conclusions about the safety of a state or a city where the volume of petty crime is higher than another state or city where the number of total crimes is comparatively low, but the number of grave crimes is high. Another area for improvement is the unavailability of data on all urban areas in the country. Capturing data on all urban areas will require an enormous effort. A starting point is to collect and compile the data generated by the 71 police commissionerates across the country that have been established over the years in the larger urban areas. Later, data collection could be expanded to cities with populations above one lakh and other smaller cities in stages. Furthermore, the nature of crime is evolving; newer kinds of crime are emerging, and more laws are being enacted, resulting in more heads of crime under which data is collected.\u00a0 More research must be conducted on the causes of crime in India. As the country urbanises, the nature and complexity of crime will likely evolve while the instances of crime increase. The NCRB, therefore, must continuously examine how it collects and organises crime data. Conclusion While crime rates in India are rising, it is still a reasonably peaceful country. According to one assessment of crime rates by country (2024), India ranks 79th among 197 countries. According to the Global Organized Crime Index, a tool to measure levels of organised crime in a country, India ranks 61st among 193 countries. Still, India must maintain a constant vigil to achieve and maintain a low level of crime across the country. Given the linkages between crime and poverty, unemployment, and inequality, the country must focus on significantly curbing or eliminating such weaknesses in the domestic socioeconomic profile. Notably, given the dynamics of urban crime and since India is set to urbanise rapidly in the coming years, greater stress on addressing crime in cities is needed. The NCRB analysis is wanting on this front, and more needs to be done in urban crime analysis beyond mere data collection. For instance, some areas that require further study are the criminal behaviour of different sets of people, and migratory populations and whether they have a propensity towards particular crimes. Additionally, the country must also consider ways to improve the quality of policing and reforming processes in the criminal justice system for the faster closure of cases. Finally, the NCRB must seek to improve data reliability by undertaking a nationwide crime victimisation survey that will lend greater authenticity to crime statistics collected nationwide. Endnotes The NCRB is an official organ of the Ministry of Home Affairs and is India\u2019s storehouse of information on crimes and criminals. As a government entity, the NCRB is well positioned to access information from the State Records Bureaus, District Records Bureaus, and police commissionerates in metropolitan cities. Unlike the laws in the penal code that apply to the entire country, special and local laws are made to handle criminal activities in a specific state or area of a state. They address the unique needs, customs, and cultural practices that are issues within that state or area. The NCRB report uses the population and area of urban agglomerations larger than the municipal limits of the cities for its assessments. As such, for Delhi, it considers the entire National Capital Region (which includes neighbouring such as Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Noida). While some urban agglomerations only marginally satisfy the two million criteria, others have large populations (some even upwards of 20 million). The decennial Census was scheduled to be conducted in 2021 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCRB has used the following sources to estimate India\u2019s population in 2022: the report of the technical group on population projections (July 2020), under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\u2019s National Commission on Population (estimates are based on the 2011 Census).

Crime victimisation is a survey process in which individual citizens voluntarily disclose if they have been the targets of criminal acts. The rate is calculated as total victimisations per 1000 persons. Assessing 2021 data alongside 2022 data (as presented in the NCRB\u2019s 2023 report) allows a direct comparison, as the number of cities reported on and the format of reporting were the same for both years. It also shows the sharp increase in crime against women, necessitating a more concerted attempt to take remedial steps. This is the propensity of a person to report a crime that has been committed.

Poaching and wildlife trafficking [ ] Illegal wildlife trade in India has increased. According to a report published by the (EIA) in 2004, India is the chief target for the traders of wildlife skin. Between 1994 and 2003, there have been 784 cases where the skins of tiger, leopard or have been seized. , , , birds, insects, rare species of plants are being smuggled into the countries in Southeast Asia and the People's Republic of China. Between 1994 and 2003, poaching and seizure of 698 otters have been documented in India. is a key staging point for illegal skins smuggled from India bound for and PRC. The report by EIA noted there has been a lack of cross-border cooperation between India, and the People's Republic of to coordinate enforcement operations and lack of political will to treat wildlife crime effectively. The poaching of is a significant problem in Southern India and in the North-Eastern states of and . In 2015-17, led to the arrest of 72 individuals and the seizure of 464 kg of ivory. The majority of tiger happen in , Uttar Pradesh, , West Bengal, and . There was a famous leopard poaching case at in Kerala in 2021.

With 23 tiger reserves, Project Tiger claimed to have succeeded. But according to critics like conservationist Billy Arjan Singh, temporary increases in tiger population were caused by immigration due to destruction of habitat in Nepal, not because of the widely acclaimed success of wildlife policy in India. Cyber crime [ ] The Information Technology Act 2000 was passed by the in May 2000, aiming to curb cyber crimes and provide a legal framework for transactions. However Pavan Duggal, lawyer of and cyber law expert, viewed \"The IT Act, 2000, is primarily meant to be a legislation to promote e-commerce. It is not very effective in dealing with several emerging cyber crimes like , , stalking and so on\". Although cyber crime cells have been set up in major cities, Duggal noted the problem is that most cases remain unreported due to a lack of awareness. In 2001, India and United States had set up an India-US cyber security forum as part of a counter-terrorism dialogue. In 2021, according to data, 52,974 cyber crime cases were registered in India, a rise of 5% compared to 2020 (50,035) cases. reported highest number of cyber crimes in India with 10,303 cases, followed by Uttar Pradesh (8,829) and Karnataka (8,136) in the number of cyber crimes reported, while Karnataka registered highest number of cyber crimes against women. In 2021, the motive behind 60.8% of the cyber crimes was fraud, followed by sexual exploitation in 8.6% (4,555) cases and extortion in 5.4% (2,883) cases. India ranked second globally in terms of cyber crimes on health systems in 2021, according to a report by CloudSEK, a company which predicts cyber threats. The breached data included vaccination records, personally identifiable information, like name, address, email, contact number, and gender, and log in details of hospitals. Such attacks can also shut down equipment during surgery or in intensive care units. Corruption and police misconduct [ ] Main article: Corruption is widespread in India. It is prevalent within every section and every level of the society. Corruption has taken the role of a pervasive aspect of Indian politics. In India, corruption takes the form of bribes, evasion of and , , etc. Despite state prohibitions against torture and custodial by the police, in police custody, which is a major reason behind . The police often torture innocent people until a 'confession' is obtained to save influential and wealthy offenders. G.P. Joshi, the programme coordinator of the Indian branch of the in comments that the main issue at hand concerning police violence is a lack of accountability of the police. In 2006, the in a judgment in the case, ordered central and state governments with seven directives to begin the process of police reform. The main objectives of this set of directives was twofold, providing tenure to and streamlining the appointment/transfer processes of policemen, and increasing the accountability of the police. In 2006, seven policemen were charge sheeted and eleven were convicted for custodial misconduct. is being planned to reduce the corruption. Other crimes [ ] Petty crime [ ] Petty crime, like , theft of valuables from luggage on trains and buses have been reported. Travelers who are not in groups become easy victims of pickpockets and purse snatchers. Purse snatchers work in crowded areas. Confidence tricks [ ] Many scams are perpetrated against foreign travelers, especially in , the capital of . Scammers usually target younger foreign tourists and suggest to them that money can be made by privately transporting gems or gold, or by taking delivery abroad of expensive carpets, avoiding customs duties. Such incidents occupy the traveler for several days. The traveler is then passed to a new scam artist who offers to show the foreign traveler the sights. Scam artists also offer cheap lodgings and meals to foreign travelers so they can place him or her in the scam artist's physical custody and thus make the foreigner vulnerable to threats and physical coercion. In the process, the foreigner loses his passport. Besides these, there are also unofficial guides to watch out for. They can be found all over India such as at crowded transportation hubs and at tourist attractions. A common ruse at transportation hubs is to claim that there is no train to your destination or to claim that a place is closed. The aim is to get you to take their expensive private transport or to an expensive hotel where they get a cut. As for the guides at tourist attractions, these could be temples, mosques, or places such as the Varanasi Ghat. You will end up receiving unsolicited services and then asked to pay a big tip for them. Taxi scam [ ] There are also taxi scams present in India, whereby a foreign traveler, who is not aware of the locations around Indian airports, is taken for a ride round the whole airport and charged for full-fare taxi ride while the terminal is only few hundred yards away. Overseas Security Advisory Council in a report mentioned the process about how to avoid taxi-scam. This crime is known in other areas of the world as \"long-hauling\". Preventing crimes [ ] Crime prevention is critical to maintain law and order in the country. Deterring criminals through deployment of more police is one of the major strategy practiced. However, their relationship is very complex. There are also other reasons such as unemployment, poverty, a lower per capita income which can affect the crime rates in India.

Criminality trends in each country are treated separately; however, several patterns in the general trends in criminality can be discerned. Increasing crime trends have been observed in Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, with different degrees of gravity. In Bangladesh and the Philippines, the crime trends reached their apexes in the early 1970's when law and order confronted a real crisis, but they have been on the decrease since then. A similar tendency was seen in Afghanistan and Singapore. On the other hand, Indonesia, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, and the Republic of Korea have shown somewhat stable or fluctuating trends in criminality, while Japan has experienced declining rates of crime. Interpretations of the crime trends consider the significance of urban life; they posit that the presence of urban slums is associated with a high incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency and the complexity of urban life has encouraged organized crime. Also, the rapid social change from simple rural life to complicated urban life, economic hardships and unemployment, markedly pluralistic societies that have been plagued by unsolved minority problems, and the disruption of traditional social controls have contributed to the growth of crime. Effective measures for reducing criminality are community development programs, stronger police services, community involvement in crime prevention, intensified criminal sanctions, and public participation in the criminal justice process. Background statistical data are provided.

Crime Statistics broadly reflects the status of operations of Criminal Justice System in a Country. Crime Statistics includes data on Offences - Breaches of the law Offenders - Those who commit offences Victims - Those who are offended against In India Crime statistics are generated on the basis of crime records maintained by different law enforcing agencies like the Police, the Judiciary at different level of administrative/legal jurisdiction under the federative system of India. These statistics are normally readily available and are generally used for assessing how crime is being dealt with by law enforcement organisations, However, these statistics being based on those cases which are generally reported to the law enforcement agencies and recorded through all stages of action on the cases reported. 'Crime Statistics' in India gives an incomplete picture of crime situations in the country. The deficiency is not particular to India, as some studies have shown that even data collected by British Crime Statistics provides a picture of $30%$ of the actual crime in the country. 37.2 Source of Crime Statistics : 37.2.1 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is the nodal agency at the centre to collect, compile and disseminate the information related with crime. \u201cCrime in India\u201d, an annual compilation of NCRB, is being published since 1953. For this publication, the information in 22 standardized formats is being collected from all the 35 States/UTs as well as from 35 mega cities. 37.2.2 Internationally , data on crime & drugs is maintained by United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) . UNODC collects data on crime and the operation of criminal justice systems in order to make policy-relevant information and analysis available in a timely manner to the international community. UNODC works on the development of standards for national crime and criminal justice information systems and for the conduct of victimization surveys. The office also aims to enhance the cross-national comparability of data through the development of key indicators and data reporting tools. Periodic reports of UNODC on selected crime issues provide in-depth analysis on key topics of concern at the global and regional level. 37.2.3 Recognizing the importance of Crime Statistics , UNODC in cooperation with United Nations Statistical Division launched the Eleventh United Nations survey of Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (11th UN-CTS )for the period 2007-08. The major goal of the survey was to collect the data on incidence of reported crimes and operations of criminal justice system. India has also participated in the survey. The survey results provide an overview of trends and interrelationships between various parts of the criminal justice system to promote informed decision-making in administration, nationally and internationally. Data collection through the CTS is conducted on an annual basis. The First & Second UNCTS was conducted during 1970-80. 37.2.4 The information maintained by UNODC includes : Statistics on Crime : Homicide, assaults sexual violence, robbery , kidnapping, theft burglary , drug related crime . Statistics on Drug Use. Statistics on Criminal Justice: Persons prosecuted, convicted, detained , Criminal Justice system resources etc. 37.3 Procedure for Collection of Crime Statistics: The flow of information starts from the Police stations wherein the cognizable offence is reported in the form of First Information Report (FIR).FIR sets the process of Criminal Justice in motion. The information thereafter flows from District Crime Record Bureaus to State Crime Record Bureau and the same is finally consolidated by National Crime Records Bureau . 37.4 Genesis of National Crime Records Bureau : Setting up of National Crime Records Bureau was recommended by the National Police Commission set up in 1977 . Accepting the recommendations, the Ministry of Home Affairs constituted a Task Force in 1985 to work out the modalities for setting up of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The Government accepted the recommendations of the Task Force and constituted the NCRB with headquarters at New Delhi in January, 1986. The objectives of the Bureau are : i. To function as a clearing house of information on crime and criminals including those operating at National and International levels so as to assists the investigators, and others in linking crimes to their perpetrators. ii. To store, coordinate and disseminate information on inter-state and international criminals from and to respective States, national investigating agencies, courts and prosecutors in India without having to refer to the Police Station records. iii. To collect and process crime statistics at the National level. 37.5 Major Issues :37.5.1 Major issues pertaining to crime statistics include : i. Large extent of non-reporting/ recording of crime/ offences at different levels of administration, particularly with reference to non-cognizable offences having social implications ii. Inadequate coverage of crime heads \u2013 under-coverage due to non-reporting for identified reasons. iii. Reliability \u2013 systemic biases, errors due to overlaps between different sections of IPC, outreach to vulnerable (women, children and backward communities). iv. Timeliness \u2013 rationalization of data flow. v. Identification of new types of crime/ offences for collection of statistics thereon. 37.5.2 The above issues were discussed by Committee on Crime Statistics constituted in October, 2010 by the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation. Crime is a state subject and state governments might be sensitive to the number of cases reported in their domains. States with better reporting systems or more empowered and educated public might record higher rates of crime. Further, in lot of cases the offended person may not report the crime out of social considerations or out of the fear of consequences eg. crime against women, children etc .

        "markdown": "Combating crime is a daunting task given its magnitude and gravity, points out Kriti Kalra and lists several activists in the country who have been leaving no stone unturned through multiple methods and strategies to raise awareness, provide support, and demand accountability to reduce or eliminate the causes that lead to crimes. She pleads that victims of crime get justice and support to heal from their trauma and rebuild their lives. Crime is a serious problem that affects the lives and rights of millions of people in India. Crime prevention, detection and eradication are the three main aspects of combating crime and ensuring justice and security for the citizens. There are, however, several lacunae and a pressing need for reforms in the criminal justice system. Several activists in India who are working in this area have been using various methods and strategies to raise awareness, provide support, and demand accountability, especially in the context of terror attacks and attacks on girls and women living alone in hostels, as paying guests, etc., with examples like the 2012 murder of lawyer Pallavi Purkayastha , the 2023 murder of Mumbai\u2019s Marine Drive hostelite by security guard who later killed himself and the more recent killing of xxxxxxxxxxx. Crime prevention is the process of reducing or eliminating the factors that cause or facilitate crime, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, lack of education, etc. Crime prevention also involves creating a culture of respect for human rights and the rule of law, and empowering the vulnerable groups to protect themselves from violence and exploitation. Preventing crime Kirti Bharti is a 29-year-old activist who has stopped 900 child marriages in the last four years and annulled 150 marriages involving underage boys and girls. She founded Saarthi Trust in 2012, a non-profit organisation that protects victims of child marriages. She has also documented cases of enforced disappearances and investigated unmarked graves in Kashmir. She has faced several death threats from villagers, caste councils and local politicians for her work. Ashok Row Kavi, a 69-year-old journalist and activist who is dubbed as the father of India\u2019s gay community, founded India\u2019s first gay magazine, Bombay Dost in 1990. He has also been a representative at the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam and was among the first people to speak openly about gays and gay rights in India. A 32-year-old activist Manisha Mashaal fights against caste-based violence and discrimination, especially against Dalit women. She is the founder of Swabhiman Society, a grassroots organisation that provides legal aid, counselling, education and livelihood opportunities to Dalit women who have faced atrocities such as rape, murder, acid attacks, etc. She has also organised several rallies and campaigns to demand justice for Dalit victims. Crime detection Crime detection is the process of identifying and apprehending the perpetrators of crime, using various techniques such as forensic science, surveillance, interrogation, etc. Crime detection also involves ensuring that the evidence collected is reliable, admissible and sufficient to prove the guilt or innocence of the accused. Santosh Hegde is a 79-year-old former judge and anti-corruption crusader who has exposed several scams and scandals involving politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen, etc. He was a member of the Lokpal Bill drafting committee in 2011. He has also served as the Lokayukta (ombudsman) of Karnataka from 2006 to 2011, where he investigated cases of illegal mining, land grabbing, tax evasion, etc. A 40-year-old lawyer and environmentalist Afroz Shah has led the world\u2019s largest beach cleanup project at Versova beach in Mumbai since 2015. He has also filed several public interest litigations (PILs) in courts to protect the environment and wildlife from pollution, encroachment, poaching, etc. He has won several awards and recognition for his work, including the UN Champion of the Earth award in 2016. Harsh Mander, a 66-year-old social activist and writer has worked on various issues such as communal violence, human rights, hunger, homelessness, etc. He is the founder of Aman Biradari (Peace Brotherhood), a campaign for secularism, peace and justice. He has also been involved in fact-finding missions and legal interventions in cases of mass violence such as the Gujarat riots in 2002. [![Santosh Hegde, Former Judge of the Supreme Court of India; Pramila Nesargi , Eminent lawyer and women s rights activist ; Dr. Binayak Sen, Paediatrician and national vice-president of PUCL](https://i0.wp.com/www.siesoiop.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Crime-prevention-and-eradication-2.png?w=1197&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/oneindiaonepeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Crime-prevention-and-eradication-2.png?ssl=1) Santosh Hegde, Former Judge of the Supreme Court of India; Pramila Nesargi , Eminent lawyer and women\\ s rights activist ; Dr. Binayak Sen, Paediatrician and national vice-president of PUCL Crime eradication Crime eradication is the process of eliminating or reducing the recurrence or impact of crime, using various measures such as punishment, rehabilitation, restitution, compensation, etc. Crime eradication also involves ensuring that the victims of crime receive justice and support to heal from their trauma and rebuild their lives. Pramila Nesargi is a 74-year-old lawyer and women\u2019s rights activist who has fought for several landmark cases involving rape, dowry deaths, domestic violence, sexual harassment, etc. She is also a former chairperson of Karnataka State Commission for Women. Doctor and human rights activist Binayak Sen has worked for the health and welfare of the tribal and rural communities in Chhattisgarh. He is also a co-founder of People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a civil liberties organisation. He has been arrested and charged with sedition and links with Maoists, but has been released on bail by the Supreme Court. Bezwada Wilson is a 54-year-old activist and leader of the Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA), a movement to eradicate manual scavenging, a practice of cleaning human excreta by hand. He has campaigned for the implementation of the laws banning manual scavenging and providing rehabilitation and compensation to the workers. He has also filed several PILs in courts to seek justice for the victims of manual scavenging. Important cases reflecting lacunae In the past and more recently also, several crimes have occurred that highlight the lacunae in the system. Attacks on women have been particularly blaring, more so because some of them were committed by those who were responsible for their security in the first place. In 2012, a 25-year-old advocate Pallavi Purkayastha was killed by the security guard of her building in Wadala, Mumbai. The guard was later arrested from a village near Srinagar. He jumped parole in February 2016 from Nashik jail and was absconding. According to police officers, the security guard changed his appearance and had been on the move. More recently, in 2023, a girl living in a hostel at Mumbai\u2019s Marine Drive was killed by the security guard of the hostel. The body of the 18-year-old girl was found naked in her hostel room. The watchman, a native of Uttar Pradesh was later found dead on railways tracks near the hostel. Police clearance is especially important for security guards, watchmen, servants, maids, drivers and workers who work in residential complexes and housing societies in Mumbai. Mumbai is one of the most populous and cosmopolitan cities in India, which attracts a large number of migrants from different parts of the country and abroad. Mumbai also has a high crime rate, as per the National Crime Records Bureau report for 2021. According to the report, Mumbai registered 63,689 cases of various crimes in 2021, which was a 27 per cent increase from 50,158 cases in 2020 and 40,684 cases in 2019. The report also showed that Mumbai ranked 11th among urban centres in terms of crime rate, which is the number of cases registered per lakh population. It is imperative that the residents of housing societies ensure police clearance for their servants, maids, drivers and workers before hiring them or allowing them to work in their premises. Police clearance can help to prevent or reduce the risk of becoming a victim of crime by verifying the identity and background of the person. Police clearance can also help to deter or discourage the person from committing any crime in the future by creating a record of his or her details and history.

        "html": "Combating crime is a daunting task given its magnitude and gravity, points out Kriti Kalra and lists several activists in the country who have been leaving no stone unturned through multiple methods and strategies to raise awareness, provide support, and demand accountability to reduce or eliminate the causes that lead to crimes. She pleads that victims of crime get justice and support to heal from their trauma and rebuild their lives. C rime is a serious problem that affects the lives and rights of millions of people in India. Crime prevention, detection and eradication are the three main aspects of combating crime and ensuring justice and security for the citizens. There are, however, several lacunae and a pressing need for reforms in the criminal justice system. Several activists in India who are working in this area have been using various methods and strategies to raise awareness, provide support, and demand accountability, especially in the context of terror attacks and attacks on girls and women living alone in hostels, as paying guests, etc., with examples like the 2012 murder of lawyer Pallavi Purkayastha , the 2023 murder of Mumbai\u2019s Marine Drive hostelite by security guard who later killed himself and the more recent killing of xxxxxxxxxxx . Crime prevention is the process of reducing or eliminating the factors that cause or facilitate crime, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, lack of education, etc. Crime prevention also involves creating a culture of respect for human rights and the rule of law, and empowering the vulnerable groups to protect themselves from violence and exploitation. Preventing crime Kirti Bharti is a 29-year-old activist who has stopped 900 child marriages in the last four years and annulled 150 marriages involving underage boys and girls. She founded Saarthi Trust in 2012, a non-profit organisation that protects victims of child marriages. She has also documented cases of enforced disappearances and investigated unmarked graves in Kashmir. She has faced several death threats from villagers, caste councils and local politicians for her work. Ashok Row Kavi, a 69-year-old journalist and activist who is dubbed as the father of India\u2019s gay community, founded India\u2019s first gay magazine, Bombay Dost in 1990. He has also been a representative at the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam and was among the first people to speak openly about gays and gay rights in India. A 32-year-old activist Manisha Mashaal fights against caste-based violence and discrimination, especially against Dalit women. She is the founder of Swabhiman Society, a grassroots organisation that provides legal aid, counselling, education and livelihood opportunities to Dalit women who have faced atrocities such as rape, murder, acid attacks, etc. She has also organised several rallies and campaigns to demand justice for Dalit victims. Crime detection Crime detection is the process of identifying and apprehending the perpetrators of crime, using various techniques such as forensic science, surveillance, interrogation, etc. Crime detection also involves ensuring that the evidence collected is reliable, admissible and sufficient to prove the guilt or innocence of the accused. Santosh Hegde is a 79-year-old former judge and anti-corruption crusader who has exposed several scams and scandals involving politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen, etc. He was a member of the Lokpal Bill drafting committee in 2011. He has also served as the Lokayukta (ombudsman) of Karnataka from 2006 to 2011, where he investigated cases of illegal mining, land grabbing, tax evasion, etc. A 40-year-old lawyer and environmentalist Afroz Shah has led the world\u2019s largest beach cleanup project at Versova beach in Mumbai since 2015. He has also filed several public interest litigations (PILs) in courts to protect the environment and wildlife from pollution, encroachment, poaching, etc. He has won several awards and recognition for his work, including the UN Champion of the Earth award in 2016. Harsh Mander, a 66-year-old social activist and writer has worked on various issues such as communal violence, human rights, hunger, homelessness, etc. He is the founder of Aman Biradari (Peace Brotherhood), a campaign for secularism, peace and justice. He has also been involved in fact-finding missions and legal interventions in cases of mass violence such as the Gujarat riots in 2002. Santosh Hegde, Former Judge of the Supreme Court of India; Pramila Nesargi , Eminent lawyer and women`s rights activist ; Dr. Binayak Sen, Paediatrician and national vice-president of PUCL Crime eradication Crime eradication is the process of eliminating or reducing the recurrence or impact of crime, using various measures such as punishment, rehabilitation, restitution, compensation, etc. Crime eradication also involves ensuring that the victims of crime receive justice and support to heal from their trauma and rebuild their lives. Pramila Nesargi is a 74-year-old lawyer and women\u2019s rights activist who has fought for several landmark cases involving rape, dowry deaths, domestic violence, sexual harassment, etc. She is also a former chairperson of Karnataka State Commission for Women. Doctor and human rights activist Binayak Sen has worked for the health and welfare of the tribal and rural communities in Chhattisgarh. He is also a co-founder of People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a civil liberties organisation. He has been arrested and charged with sedition and links with Maoists, but has been released on bail by the Supreme Court. Bezwada Wilson is a 54-year-old activist and leader of the Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA), a movement to eradicate manual scavenging, a practice of cleaning human excreta by hand. He has campaigned for the implementation of the laws banning manual scavenging and providing rehabilitation and compensation to the workers. He has also filed several PILs in courts to seek justice for the victims of manual scavenging. Important cases reflecting lacunae In the past and more recently also, several crimes have occurred that highlight the lacunae in the system. Attacks on women have been particularly blaring, more so because some of them were committed by those who were responsible for their security in the first place. In 2012, a 25-year-old advocate Pallavi Purkayastha was killed by the security guard of her building in Wadala, Mumbai. The guard was later arrested from a village near Srinagar. He jumped parole in February 2016 from Nashik jail and was absconding. According to police officers, the security guard changed his appearance and had been on the move. More recently, in 2023, a girl living in a hostel at Mumbai\u2019s Marine Drive was killed by the security guard of the hostel. The body of the 18-year-old girl was found naked in her hostel room. The watchman, a native of Uttar Pradesh was later found dead on railways tracks near the hostel. Police clearance is especially important for security guards, watchmen, servants, maids, drivers and workers who work in residential complexes and housing societies in Mumbai. Mumbai is one of the most populous and cosmopolitan cities in India, which attracts a large number of migrants from different parts of the country and abroad. Mumbai also has a high crime rate, as per the National Crime Records Bureau report for 2021. According to the report, Mumbai registered 63,689 cases of various crimes in 2021, which was a 27 per cent increase from 50,158 cases in 2020 and 40,684 cases in 2019. The report also showed that Mumbai ranked 11th among urban centres in terms of crime rate, which is the number of cases registered per lakh population. It is imperative that the residents of housing societies ensure police clearance for their servants, maids, drivers and workers before hiring them or allowing them to work in their premises. Police clearance can help to prevent or reduce the risk of becoming a victim of crime by verifying the identity and background of the person. Police clearance can also help to deter or discourage the person from committing any crime in the future by creating a record of his or her details and history.

It offers an expansive overview of crime prevention initiatives and how they are applied across a wide range of themes and infractions, from conventional to non-conventional forms of crime. Based on a review of the literature, this is the first text to offer a broad, yet comprehensive, examination of how and why crime prevention has gained considerable traction as an alternative to conventional criminal justice practices of crime control in developed countries, and to provide a cross-sectional view of how crime prevention has been applied and how effective such initiatives have been. Crime Prevention: International Perspectives, Issues, and Trends is suitable for undergraduate students in criminology and criminal justice programs, as well as for graduates and undergraduates in special topics courses.

He gained his PhD from Simon Fraser University and has recently returned to Mount Royal after time spent in Germany as a Visiting Scholar at the Max Planck Institute in Freiburg. He has published a number of books, including a recent edited book entitled Border Security in the Al-Qaeda Era , co-edited with Kelly Sundberg (MRU), as well as editing a book on human trafficking with Philip Reichel (Un. of Northern Colorado) and Benjamin Perrin (Un. of British Columbia). He is also working on a fourth edition of a textbook on youth justice. He recently completed a book entitled Inequality, Diversity and Canadian Justice (Nelson) with Doug King. Dr. Winterdyk's current research interests include Canadian border security, in particular looking at the effect the establishment of the Canada Border Services Agency has on the Canadian publics' perception of border security. Dr. Winterdyk recently completed a cross-national research project looking at combating human trafficking with scholars from Canada, USA and Austria, funded through the National Institute of Justice, and taken part in studies on identity theft (the first of its kind in Canada) and on mass marketing fraud. Dr. Winterdyk recently served as guest editor for a special issue on genocide for the International Criminal Review as well as a co-guest editor (with Philip Reichel) of European Journal of Criminology, which looks at human trafficking. His research projects include: human trafficking, fear of crime, border security, and prison gangs. In January 2010, Dr. Winterdyk became the Director of the Centre for Criminology and Justice Research Projects\u2019 pilot study, Human Trafficking: Formalizing a Localized Response . Critics' Reviews Winterdyk has accomplished a remarkable milestone in editing a collection of the most exciting contributions to crime prevention in recent years. This is an outstanding collection of readings by internationally distinguished scholars on a wide variety of crime prevention issues. Students and practitioners alike will benefit by having these chapters together in a single volume. As for policymakers, the book should be required reading. -- Georgios A. Antonopoulos, Teesside University This latest work by Winterdyk belongs to, and at the same time stands out from, the larger tradition of his scholarly work. The merit of the synoptic approach covering the four corners of crime prevention issues lies in the implicit assumption of a constructivist perspective, and profoundly invites policymakers to leave behind any narrow and limiting understanding of crime prevention. In editing an impressive and diverse collection of work on crime prevention, Winterdyk provides the basis for a holistic perspective. Much of this text could/should become required reading for students of criminal justice at the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST) and beyond. \u2013 Stefan Schulz , Namibia University of Science and Technology The contributors to this anthology shift the discussion about crime from its traditional focus on control to prevention, using examples from across the globe. The contributors provide a wealth of information and insight into crime prevention organized around three themes: a global overview of the challenges of implementing these strategies, the prevention of specific crimes (from child abuse to terrorism), and how prevention fits in the crime management discourse. Winterdyk has done a remarkable job of bringing these experts and scholars together to present a topical/issues-oriented approach that is supported by learning outcomes and critical questions. \u2013 Professor Rick Ruddell, Law Foun Cookies Button About Cookies On This Site We and our partners use cookies to enhance your website experience, learn how our site is used, offer personalised features, measure the effectiveness of our services, and tailor content and ads to your interests while you navigate on the web or interact with us across devices.

        "markdown": "Data extracted in April 2025 Planned article update: April 2026 Crime statistics Data extracted in April 2025 Planned article update: April 2026 Highlights The number of intentional homicides in the EU increased by 1.5% in 2023, compared with 2022. In the EU, 4.1 per one million women were victims of intentional homicide, nearly double the rate for men in 2023. In 2023, sexual violence offences, including rape, continued to rise in the EU. Police-recorded crimes against property in the EU increased in 2023: thefts rose by 4.8%, robberies by 2.7% and burglaries by 4.2% compared with the previous year. Source: Eurostat The statistics presented in this article are based on official figures for police-recorded offences (criminal acts) in Europe between 2008 and 2023. The number of police-recorded crimes varies widely across the EU, even relative to population size. This can be due to different laws, different police recording practices and different reporting rates to the police, which can affect comparison. 3 930 intentional homicides in the EU in 2023 In 2023, police recorded 3\u00a0930 in the EU, compared with the previous year, an increase of 1.5% (Figure\u00a01). An increase was observed in 11 of the 27 EU countries, with the biggest upward changes in absolute numbers occurring in Germany and France. Figure 1: Intentional homicide, 2008-2023 Source: Eurostat Number of women killed by family members is nearly double than for men The number of female victims of intentional homicide killed by family members or intimate partners in 2023 was 4.1 per one million women, nearly double the rate for male victims, 2.2 per million men. Women are more frequently victims of intentional homicide by family members or intimate partners \u2013 the EU rate per one million women fluctuated between 3.9 and 4.4 from 2015 to 2023, peaking in 2022 (Figure\u00a02). In 2023, the rate decreased to 4.1. By contrast the EU rate of intentional homicide male victims killed by family members or intimate partners remained notably lower than those for women. Over the same period, it ranged from 1.9 to 2.3 per one million men with the lowest values in 2016 and 2021. In 2023, the rate increased from 2.0 in 2022 to 2.2 male victims per one million men. These figures highlight the persistent gender disparity in domestic and intimate partner homicides across the EU. Figure 2: Intentional homicide victims by family members or intimate partners, male and female, 2015-2023 Source: Eurostat The number of sexual violence offences increased during 2013-2023 From 2013 to 2023 the number of offences, including , as recorded by police in the EU, has shown a steady increase, reaching a 79.2% increase in 2023 as compared with 2013. The number of rape offences, as a part of sexual violence offences, more than doubled during this period (a 141% increase) (Figure\u00a03). In 2023, 243\u00a0715 sexual violence offences (including 91\u00a0370 rape offences) were registered, showing a 5.5% increase (including a 7% increase in rape) compared with 2022. The increased number of police-recorded sexual violence offences are closely connected to raising awareness in the society and might impact reporting rates. Figure 3: Sexual violence and rape, 2013-2023 Source: Eurostat Number of property related offences have increased after the pandemic During the pandemic (2020-2021), police-recorded offences in the EU had their lowest dip in 2021 \u2013 a decrease of 19.2% compared with 2019 (Figure\u00a04). In 2023, there were 5\u00a0387\u00a0857 registered thefts, a 23.5% increase compared with 2021, and a 4.8% increase compared with 2022. In 2023, the number of police-registered offences was 1\u00a0229\u00a0429. After a steady decrease from 2010 to 2021, the number of police-recorded burglary offences showed an 11.9% increase compared with 2021 and a 4.2% increase compared with 2022. is less prevalent, however, the most serious property related crime of the 3. In 2023, in the EU, the number of police-recorded robbery offences was 261\u00a0361, an increase of 13.2% compared with 2021 and a 2.7% increase compared with 2022.

In the EU, 4.1 per one million women were victims of intentional homicide, nearly double the rate for men in 2023. In 2023, sexual violence offences, including rape, continued to rise in the EU. Police-recorded crimes against property in the EU increased in 2023: thefts rose by 4.8%, robberies by 2.7% and burglaries by 4.2% compared with the previous year. Source: Eurostat The statistics presented in this article are based on official figures for police-recorded offences (criminal acts) in Europe between 2008 and 2023.  The number of police-recorded crimes varies widely across the EU, even relative to population size. This can be due to different laws, different police recording practices and different reporting rates to the police, which can affect comparison. 3 930 intentional homicides in the EU in 2023 In 2023, police recorded 3\u00a0930 in the EU, compared with the previous year, an increase of 1.5% (Figure\u00a01). An increase was observed in 11 of the 27 EU countries, with the biggest upward changes in absolute numbers occurring in Germany and France. Figure 1: Intentional homicide, 2008-2023 Source: Eurostat Number of women killed by family members is nearly double than for men The number of female victims of intentional homicide killed by family members or intimate partners in 2023 was 4.1 per one million women, nearly double the rate for male victims, 2.2 per million men. Women are more frequently victims of intentional homicide by family members or intimate partners \u2013 the EU rate per one million women fluctuated between 3.9 and 4.4 from 2015 to 2023, peaking in 2022 (Figure\u00a02). In 2023, the rate decreased to 4.1. By contrast the EU rate of intentional homicide male victims killed by family members or intimate partners remained notably lower than those for women. Over the same period, it ranged from 1.9 to 2.3 per one million men with the lowest values in 2016 and 2021. In 2023, the rate increased from 2.0 in 2022 to 2.2 male victims per one million men. These figures highlight the persistent gender disparity in domestic and intimate partner homicides across the EU. Figure 2: Intentional homicide victims by family members or intimate partners, male and female, 2015-2023 Source: Eurostat The number of sexual violence offences increased during 2013-2023 From 2013 to 2023 the number of offences, including , as recorded by police in the EU, has shown a steady increase, reaching a 79.2% increase in 2023 as compared with 2013. The number of rape offences, as a part of sexual violence offences, more than doubled during this period (a 141% increase) (Figure\u00a03). In 2023, 243\u00a0715 sexual violence offences (including 91\u00a0370 rape offences) were registered, showing a 5.5% increase (including a 7% increase in rape) compared with 2022. The increased number of police-recorded sexual violence offences are closely connected to raising awareness in the society and might impact reporting rates. Figure 3: Sexual violence and rape, 2013-2023 Source: Eurostat Number of property related offences have increased after the pandemic During the pandemic (2020-2021), police-recorded offences in the EU had their lowest dip in 2021 \u2013 a decrease of 19.2% compared with 2019 (Figure\u00a04). In 2023, there were 5\u00a0387\u00a0857 registered thefts, a 23.5% increase compared with 2021, and a 4.8% increase compared with 2022. In 2023, the number of police-registered offences was 1\u00a0229\u00a0429.

Due to its strategic geographic location in the Caribbean, the island serves as a transit point. Therefore, many homicides are believed to be drug and gang-related. However, , on different continents. Highest murder rates in Latin America Violent crimes tend to occur more frequently in countries and regions where a high number of the population lives in poverty, and where government institutions are weak. This partly explains the found in some Latin American countries. Interestingly, El Salvador, which long had the highest global homicide rates, has dropped out of the top 20 after a high number of gang members have been incarcerated. Still, many of the are found in Latin America. The list was dominated by cities in Mexico, with Port-au-Prince in Haiti having the highest murder rate outside Mexico. However, these numbers do not include victims killed in violent conflict or war. For instance, people living in Chad had the highest risk of becoming in 2025, followed by people living in Sudan, where a mass killing episode was ongoing that year. Terrorism Since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11 in 2001, the so-called War on Terror has been one of the dominating international topics. Whereas this was the deadliest terrorist attack in history, most of the terrorist attacks in 2023 happened in countries in the Global South.

Many victims of cybercrime are and private individuals, but also public institutions. For instance, cybercrime is a common weapon in Russia\u2019s ongoing war with Ukraine. Prison and punishment Finally, imprisonment is globally recognized as a fair and supposedly efficient response to criminal activity. For instance, the current president of El Salvador, by incarcerating many gang members, has made the homicide rate drop but, his country has now the worldwide.

Join our newsletter \u00d7 By Shivam Dubey and Pooja Agarwal, Christ University Editor\u2019s Note: By using the data of National Crime Records Bureau\u00a0, the authors\u00a0have examined the overall trends and characteristics of crime, crime rates and crime control techniques in each stage of the criminal justice system in India. From the data analyzed, it has been\u00a0determine that economic, political, and societal factors have played a crucial role in the occurrence of crime and crime control practices. Recent phenomena, like the financial crisis and the current political stalemate in India, seem to have contributed to this disturbing increase in crime. If these factors can be stabilized, then we may anticipate the improvement of the crime situation in India. Abstract Crime exists in India in various forms such as murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, human trafficking, poaching and prostitution etc. These crimes have different statistical trends and it changes with change in time. This paper provides a complete picture of crime and crime control in India over past 40 years. By using the data of , we have examined overall trends and characteristics of crime, crime rates and crime control techniques in each stage of criminal justice system in India during this period. The gravity of crime in India is also examined from comparative perspective by engaging in a cross national comparison with other countries. The finding of this research indicates that the crime problem in India is more serious than other developed countries. The analysis of recent data, however, show alarming increase in serious crime such as murder, rape etc. This paper further determines the factors responsible for increase in crime rate and reached on the conclusion that political, economic and socio-cultural factors have played and will continue to play a vital role in crime and crime control practices in India. Introduction Crime is no longer viewed as only one problem to a given society. Rather it is an integral part of understanding a nation\u2019s socio, cultural, political, and economic situation. India is no exception. Crime exists in India in various forms such as murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, human trafficking, poaching and prostitution etc. It is very difficult to give a correct and precise definition of crime. Glanville Williams, admitting the impossibility of having a workable content based definition of crime, points out that the definition of crime is one of the thorny intellectual problems of law. Russell also admitted that \u2018to define crime is a task which so far has not been satisfactorily accomplished by any writer. JW Cecil Turner, who edited Kenny\u2019s Outline of Criminal Law , in a similar one, also conceded that \u2018the definition of crime has always been regarded as a matter of great difficulty\u2019 and \u2018 the truth appears to be that no satisfactory definition has yet been achieved, and that it is, indeed, not possible to discover a legal definition of crime\u2019. Sometimes various social problems stem from \u2018uncoordinated and unsystematic\u2019 social changes, particularly among those who are unable to adapt to ever-changing new environments. Rapid social change always tends to produce social disorganization, which includes crime. Although every society experiences various degrees of social change and consequent increases in crime and crime rates, rates of change differ from one society to another. If this is indeed the case, then it is possible to understand a society by examining changes in crime and crime rates where they are used as an index for measuring societal changes and their characteristics. Accordingly, this paper will attempt an overview of the trends and characteristics of crime and crime control in India and in doing so will provide a general understanding of crime in Indian society. To begin with, we will present an overall picture of crime in India by examining the trends and patterns of crime over the past four decades. We will then explore crime problems in India from a comparative perspective by conducting cross-national comparisons of crime problems in other countries. By examining the crime data, we can get a better picture of how safe it is to live in India. This will be followed by an overview of crime control practices of the criminal justice system in India. This article will conclude with a discussion of the case of India as it experiences rapid change. We will also look at how these changes influence crime and crime control practices. Data and Methods The data on crime, arrests, and prosecutions, upon which we rely, come in large part from the Analytical Report on Crime, published by National Crime Records Bureau. The Analytical Report on Crime is the most comprehensive compilation of statistical data on crime, police activity, and the Crime Rates in India. Although official crime statistics are not entirely accurate, they are the most reliable sources available and do provide an indication of crime trends. According to the Criminal Code, offenses are classified into seven sub-categories: violent crimes, property crimes, forgeries, and crimes by government officials, crimes against public morals, crimes of negligence, and others. Of these, violent and property crimes consist of approximately four-fifths of all Criminal Code Offenses. The violent crime category is composed of criminal homicide, robbery, arson, rape, assault, aggravated assault, intimidation, kidnapping, and illegal confinement. Property crimes consist of larceny theft, stolen property, fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust, and destruction of property. Official Criminal data of National Crime Records Bureau are used to determine the statistics of crime in India. Trends in Crimes This section presents an overall picture of crime trends in India. Indian society has experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization as well as a notable increase in population over the past 40 years. As a consequence, both the total number of crimes and the crime rate have increased. Crime over Time A report published by the compared the crime rates of 1953 and 2006.

Those crimes can be against human body or property. The National Crime Records Bureau has over the past 35 years (1973-2007) recorded 8 crimes that are most prevalent in India. They have made a survey of the total happening of each crime over 35 years. They are: Crime against Human Body By looking at the statistics, it is crystal clear that murder rates have doubled from 1973 (17072) to 2007(32318). This shows the amount of violence that has crept into our society. It can be concluded that the penal law in India has not done much to prevent the society from such atrocities where a man takes away the life of another man. The 1973 statistics was stable in the beginning few years with thousand murders increasing or decreasing subsequently. A steep rise in the murder rates where witnessed from 1979. The rates never saw a downfall from then and the murder rates continued to rise in the subsequent years. The maximum that it reached was in the year 1992(40105). The statistics gives us the clear picture of the society that we live in. Though the statistics have seen a downfall onwards 1998 but the fall is not significant and proportionate to the legal awareness and stringent legal mechanisms that has been adopted to avoid us horrifying human act. Rape statistics have surpassed all the boundaries in India. 2919 rapes were recorded in the year 1973, in the year 2007 the recorded number is 20737. The record shows that the rape rates have increased 6 times. The statistics have recorded every year a higher number than the previous year. This clear shows that rape laws have increased despite of all the laws. Kidnapping too like rape and murder has shown an upward trend. 1973 recorded total of 10223 and 2007 recorded a total of 27561. The rates of kidnapping have doubled in 35 years. This again shows the failure of law as a mechanism to civilize people. Therefore, the statistics proves that crime against human body has increased significantly in the last 35 years. Crime against Property A noticeable pattern could be witnessed in crime against property. The crime related to property has decreased from 1973. The rates have seen a downfall. Dacoit was 10627 in the year 1973 and 4579 in the year 2007. Though there was an initial rise but after few years, the rate of dacoit started to fall. This shows an improvement in reducing crime in the society. 18857 was the number of robbery that took place in 1973. It has increased from 1973 till 1992. There was a downfall since 1992 to 2007. Though there is not a big reduction in the number of Robbery, but it provides relief and gives a surety to that the rate will fall with the years to come. Burglary in the year 1973 was recorded to be 181433. This too has seen a downfall. 91218 is the recorded burglary in the year 2007. This shows that burglary has reduced by 2 times. This shows the reduction of such crimes in the Indian society. Theft has been recorded as 285043 in the year 2007. The scenario in 1973 was 379412. Theft too has been reduced in the past 35 years. Reasonable reduction has been witnessed in the crime trend against property in India. Riots were 73388 in the year in 1973. It has become 59915 in the year 2007. Again, there has been a significant reduction in the number of riots that have taken place in India. It shows a positive change in the society. Therefore, the number of crimes against property as analyzed above shows that the crime against property has reduced subsequently. This is a positive step that we can move ahead with.

For example, 198 homicides were recorded in the American city of Chicago in 1916, a city of slightly over 2 million at the time. This level of crime was not exceptional when compared to other American cities such as New York, but was much higher relative to European cities, such as London, which then had three times the population but recorded only 45 homicides in the same year. After World War II, crime rates increased in the United States, peaking from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Violent crime nearly quadrupled between 1960 and its peak in 1991. Property crime more than doubled over the same period. Since the 1990s, however, crime in the United States has declined steeply. In line with the crime rates of the U.S., it is interesting to note that crimes of violence, such as criminal homicide, forcible rape, and burglary as well as crimes against property have all decreased since the early 1990s (FBI, 1999). These decreases can be attributed to a number of factors. They include the economic boom which occasioned the fall in unemployment; the demographic shift of baby boomers from the crime prone age to middle-age; the success of community-policing strategies; and various crime prevention programs. Figure 2 Figure 3 Comparison \u00a0Between \u00a0India \u00a0And \u00a0US \u00a0On \u00a0The \u00a0Basis \u00a0Of \u00a0Crime \u00a0Rates Both India and USA are known to be high on the crime rate and here\u2019s a look at a quantitative comparison between the crimes committed in these two countries. As far as embezzlements are concerned, India reported 15454 cases while US recorded 17300 cases. US ranks 2nd as far as the number of fraud cases are concerned while India occupies the 12th place with a total of 41403 cases. Coming to the number of murder cases, US leads India and comes on the 88th position as per the records of the year 2004. India occupied the 110th position in the number of murder cases. In India, as per the records of the year 1995, there were 130 police men for 100000 people while US had 256 police men for 100000 people. This means that US had 140% more policemen than India. When it comes to the number of prisoners, US has ranked 1st and India has ranked 4th on the same. Infact, when it comes to the female prisoners, India has ranked 92nd while US has ranked 9th in the world. India has 49 times less prison staff than US. India has ranked 48th in the world, while US has ranked 3rd in terms of the number of prison staff in the year 1995. Even though India witnesses a lot of rape cases, it ranks 68th in the world while US ranks 5th with 17 times more rape cases than India. Factors Responsible For Increase in Crime Rates In the late 1950s, India took steps toward participatory democracy even though a lot of unstable political and social conditions continued to exist. It is interesting to note that increases in crime rates, show different patterns over the past four decades: a notable increase in the crime against human body; a decrease in crime against property. Along with the notable increase and decrease in crime, we need to understand it in a social context. Indian society experienced rapid structural changes brought on by industrialization and modernization after Independence. Major institutions like the family, schools, government, churches, and others were undergoing rapid transformation. An increasing number of Indians moved to urban areas, the society became increasingly heterogeneous. Social changes always tend to produce social disorganization, some of which is crime. In India, the rapid growth in the urban population; the increase in the stress and strains of urban life; the higher standard of living; and, the changes in the existing value systems and political system, were some of the factors contributing to the increase in the crime rate. While property crimes normally show a rapid rise with increased industrialization in India, economic growth and an increase in employment opportunities, brought on by industrialization and modernization in the cities, seemed to contribute to a moderate increase in property crimes during that time. As shown in table 1, property crime rates, by crime type was more in 1970s than it sharply decrease during the 2000s. Murder and Rape (Crime against Human Body), in particular have increased steadily in the present era, and the incidence of Robbery, Burglary, and Riots decline sharply after 2000. As Indian society increasingly put greater emphasis on material success as a means of determining personal worth, there was a correspondingly higher rate of property crime. As India enjoyed enormous economic growth, and the overall size of the Indian economy rapidly expanded during the 1990s, the number of available targets for property offenses increased as well. One of the main reasons for the sustained trend in the increase in the number of major criminal offenses may be attributed to a continued increase in the number of violations of legislation such as the \u2018Indian Penal Code\u2019. The other reason may be due to revisions and improvements of the criminal justice system, laws and regulations. The improved regulations represent an attempt to exert more efficient control over India\u2019s increasingly complex society. This social phenomenon is manifested in the rapid expansion of the scope of activities engaged in by the public, together with the various ways in which these activities are pursued as Indian society progresses. Conclusion Trends in crime and the crime rate in India over the past four decades can be summarized as follows. The incidence of crimes fluctuated during that time. One exception to this trend was the crime against human body, which displayed a general pattern of increase. However, it is especially noteworthy that the overall crime rate rose during the 1990s. \u00a0A cross national comparison with USA reveals that overall rates of crime in India were substantially lower than that in the U.S. Compared to the U.S., the overall crime rate of Crime against Human body in India has been relatively high over the past three decades. It is also noteworthy that the crime rates of violent crimes, as well as of property crimes, have all decreased in the U.S. since the early 1990s. But, in comparison between India and U.S, India can consider as the safer place as compare to U.S. According to this study, the overall crime problem in India is not as serious as that in the U.S. However, recent data indicates an alarming increase in the crime rate. From the data analyzed, we can determine that economic, political, and societal factors have played a crucial role in the occurrence of crime and crime control practices in India. Recent phenomena, like the financial crisis and the current political stalemate in India, seem to have contributed to this recent disturbing increase in crime. If these factors can be stabilized, then we may anticipate the improvement of the crime situation in India.

Abstract Crime exists in India in various forms such as murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, human trafficking, poaching and prostitution etc. These crimes have different statistical trends and it changes with change in time. This paper provides a complete picture of crime and crime control in India over past 40 years. By using the data of , we have examined overall trends and characteristics of crime, crime rates and crime control techniques in each stage of criminal justice system in India during this period. The gravity of crime in India is also examined from comparative perspective by engaging in a cross national comparison with other countries. The finding of this research indicates that the crime problem in India is more serious than other developed countries. The analysis of recent data, however, show alarming increase in serious crime such as murder, rape etc. This paper further determines the factors responsible for increase in crime rate and reached on the conclusion that political, economic and socio-cultural factors have played and will continue to play a vital role in crime and crime control practices in India. Introduction Crime is no longer viewed as only one problem to a given society. Rather it is an integral part of understanding a nation\u2019s socio, cultural, political, and economic situation. India is no exception. Crime exists in India in various forms such as murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, human trafficking, poaching and prostitution etc. It is very difficult to give a correct and precise definition of crime. Glanville Williams, admitting the impossibility of having a workable content based definition of crime, points out that the definition of crime is one of the thorny intellectual problems of law. Russell also admitted that \u2018to define crime is a task which so far has not been satisfactorily accomplished by any writer. JW Cecil Turner, who edited Kenny\u2019s Outline of Criminal Law , in a similar one, also conceded that \u2018the definition of crime has always been regarded as a matter of great difficulty\u2019 and \u2018 the truth appears to be that no satisfactory definition has yet been achieved, and that it is, indeed, not possible to discover a legal definition of crime\u2019. Sometimes various social problems stem from \u2018uncoordinated and unsystematic\u2019 social changes, particularly among those who are unable to adapt to ever-changing new environments. Rapid social change always tends to produce social disorganization, which includes crime. Although every society experiences various degrees of social change and consequent increases in crime and crime rates, rates of change differ from one society to another. If this is indeed the case, then it is possible to understand a society by examining changes in crime and crime rates where they are used as an index for measuring societal changes and their characteristics. Accordingly, this paper will attempt an overview of the trends and characteristics of crime and crime control in India and in doing so will provide a general understanding of crime in Indian society. To begin with, we will present an overall picture of crime in India by examining the trends and patterns of crime over the past four decades. We will then explore crime problems in India from a comparative perspective by conducting cross-national comparisons of crime problems in other countries. By examining the crime data, we can get a better picture of how safe it is to live in India. This will be followed by an overview of crime control practices of the criminal justice system in India. This article will conclude with a discussion of the case of India as it experiences rapid change. We will also look at how these changes influence crime and crime control practices. Data and Methods The data on crime, arrests, and prosecutions, upon which we rely, come in large part from the Analytical Report on Crime, published by National Crime Records Bureau. The Analytical Report on Crime is the most comprehensive compilation of statistical data on crime, police activity, and the Crime Rates in India. Although official crime statistics are not entirely accurate, they are the most reliable sources available and do provide an indication of crime trends. According to the Criminal Code, offenses are classified into seven sub-categories: violent crimes, property crimes, forgeries, and crimes by government officials, crimes against public morals, crimes of negligence, and others. Of these, violent and property crimes consist of approximately four-fifths of all Criminal Code Offenses. The violent crime category is composed of criminal homicide, robbery, arson, rape, assault, aggravated assault, intimidation, kidnapping, and illegal confinement. Property crimes consist of larceny theft, stolen property, fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust, and destruction of property. Official Criminal data of National Crime Records Bureau are used to determine the statistics of crime in India. Trends in Crimes This section presents an overall picture of crime trends in India. Indian society has experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization as well as a notable increase in population over the past 40 years. As a consequence, both the total number of crimes and the crime rate have increased. Crime over Time A report published by the compared the crime rates of 1953 and 2006. The report noted that burglary declined over a period of 53 years by 79.84% (from 147,379, a rate of 39.3/100,000 in 1953 to 91,666, a rate of 7.9/100,000 in 2006), murder has increased by 7.39% (from 9,803, a rate of 2.61 in 1953 to 32,481, a rate of 2.81/100,000 in 2006). has increased by 47.80% (from 5,261, a rate of 1.40/100,000 in 1953 to 23,991, a rate of 2.07/100,000 in 2006), robbery has declined by 28.85% (from 8,407, rate of 2.24/100,000 in 1953 to 18,456, rate of 18,456 in 2006) and have declined by 10.58% (from 20,529, a rate of 5.47/100,000 in 1953 to 56,641, a rate of 4.90/100,000 in 2006). In 2006, 5,102,460 cognizable crimes were committed including 1,878,293 (IPC) crimes and 3,224,167 Special & Local Laws (SLL) crimes, with an increase of 1.5% over 2005 (50,26,337). \u00a0IPC crime rate in 2006 was 167.7 compared to 165.3 in 2005 showing an increase of 1.5% in 2006 over 2005. SLL crime rate in 2006 was 287.9 compared to 290.5 in 2005 showing a decline of 0.9% in 2006 over 2005. Crime by Location Location has a significant impact on crime in India. In 2006, the highest crime rate was reported in (447.7%) for crimes under which is 2.7 times the national crime rate of 167.7%. reported the highest crime rate at 312.5% among\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 states.

Those crimes can be against human body or property. The National Crime Records Bureau has over the past 35 years (1973-2007) recorded 8 crimes that are most prevalent in India. They have made a survey of the total happening of each crime over 35 years. They are: Crime against Human Body By looking at the statistics, it is crystal clear that murder rates have doubled from 1973 (17072) to 2007(32318). This shows the amount of violence that has crept into our society. It can be concluded that the penal law in India has not done much to prevent the society from such atrocities where a man takes away the life of another man. The 1973 statistics was stable in the beginning few years with thousand murders increasing or decreasing subsequently. A steep rise in the murder rates where witnessed from 1979. The rates never saw a downfall from then and the murder rates continued to rise in the subsequent years. The maximum that it reached was in the year 1992(40105). The statistics gives us the clear picture of the society that we live in. Though the statistics have seen a downfall onwards 1998 but the fall is not significant and proportionate to the legal awareness and stringent legal mechanisms that has been adopted to avoid us horrifying human act. Rape statistics have surpassed all the boundaries in India. 2919 rapes were recorded in the year 1973, in the year 2007 the recorded number is 20737. The record shows that the rape rates have increased 6 times. The statistics have recorded every year a higher number than the previous year. This clear shows that rape laws have increased despite of all the laws. Kidnapping too like rape and murder has shown an upward trend. 1973 recorded total of 10223 and 2007 recorded a total of 27561. The rates of kidnapping have doubled in 35 years. This again shows the failure of law as a mechanism to civilize people. Therefore, the statistics proves that crime against human body has increased significantly in the last 35 years. Crime against Property A noticeable pattern could be witnessed in crime against property. The crime related to property has decreased from 1973. The rates have seen a downfall. Dacoit was 10627 in the year 1973 and 4579 in the year 2007. Though there was an initial rise but after few years, the rate of dacoit started to fall. This shows an improvement in reducing crime in the society. 18857 was the number of robbery that took place in 1973. It has increased from 1973 till 1992. There was a downfall since 1992 to 2007. Though there is not a big reduction in the number of Robbery, but it provides relief and gives a surety to that the rate will fall with the years to come. Burglary in the year 1973 was recorded to be 181433. This too has seen a downfall. 91218 is the recorded burglary in the year 2007. This shows that burglary has reduced by 2 times. This shows the reduction of such crimes in the Indian society. Theft has been recorded as 285043 in the year 2007. The scenario in 1973 was 379412. Theft too has been reduced in the past 35 years. Reasonable reduction has been witnessed in the crime trend against property in India. Riots were 73388 in the year in 1973. It has become 59915 in the year 2007. Again, there has been a significant reduction in the number of riots that have taken place in India. It shows a positive change in the society. Therefore, the number of crimes against property as analyzed above shows that the crime against property has reduced subsequently. This is a positive step that we can move ahead with.

For example, 198 homicides were recorded in the American city of Chicago in 1916, a city of slightly over 2 million at the time. This level of crime was not exceptional when compared to other American cities such as New York, but was much higher relative to European cities, such as London, which then had three times the population but recorded only 45 homicides in the same year. After World War II, crime rates increased in the United States, peaking from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Violent crime nearly quadrupled between 1960 and its peak in 1991. Property crime more than doubled over the same period. Since the 1990s, however, crime in the United States has declined steeply. In line with the crime rates of the U.S., it is interesting to note that crimes of violence, such as criminal homicide, forcible rape, and burglary as well as crimes against property have all decreased since the early 1990s (FBI, 1999). These decreases can be attributed to a number of factors. They include the economic boom which occasioned the fall in unemployment; the demographic shift of baby boomers from the crime prone age to middle-age; the success of community-policing strategies; and various crime prevention programs. Figure 2 Figure 3 Comparison \u00a0Between \u00a0India \u00a0And \u00a0US \u00a0On \u00a0The \u00a0Basis \u00a0Of \u00a0Crime \u00a0Rates Both India and USA are known to be high on the crime rate and here\u2019s a look at a quantitative comparison between the crimes committed in these two countries. As far as embezzlements are concerned, India reported 15454 cases while US recorded 17300 cases. US ranks 2 nd as far as the number of fraud cases are concerned while India occupies the 12th place with a total of 41403 cases. Coming to the number of murder cases, US leads India and comes on the 88th position as per the records of the year 2004. India occupied the 110th position in the number of murder cases. In India, as per the records of the year 1995, there were 130 police men for 100000 people while US had 256 police men for 100000 people. This means that US had 140% more policemen than India. When it comes to the number of prisoners, US has ranked 1 st and India has ranked 4 th on the same. Infact, when it comes to the female prisoners, India has ranked 92 nd while US has ranked 9 th in the world. India has 49 times less prison staff than US. India has ranked 48 th in the world, while US has ranked 3rd in terms of the number of prison staff in the year 1995. Even though India witnesses a lot of rape cases, it ranks 68th in the world while US ranks 5th with 17 times more rape cases than India. Factors Responsible For Increase in Crime Rates In the late 1950s, India took steps toward participatory democracy even though a lot of unstable political and social conditions continued to exist. It is interesting to note that increases in crime rates, show different patterns over the past four decades: a notable increase in the crime against human body; a decrease in crime against property. Along with the notable increase and decrease in crime, we need to understand it in a social context. Indian society experienced rapid structural changes brought on by industrialization and modernization after Independence. Major institutions like the family, schools, government, churches, and others were undergoing rapid transformation. An increasing number of Indians moved to urban areas, the society became increasingly heterogeneous. Social changes always tend to produce social disorganization, some of which is crime. In India, the rapid growth in the urban population; the increase in the stress and strains of urban life; the higher standard of living; and, the changes in the existing value systems and political system, were some of the factors contributing to the increase in the crime rate. While property crimes normally show a rapid rise with increased industrialization in India, economic growth and an increase in employment opportunities, brought on by industrialization and modernization in the cities, seemed to contribute to a moderate increase in property crimes during that time. As shown in table 1, property crime rates, by crime type was more in 1970s than it sharply decrease during the 2000s. Murder and Rape (Crime against Human Body), in particular have increased steadily in the present era, and the incidence of Robbery, Burglary, and Riots decline sharply after 2000. As Indian society increasingly put greater emphasis on material success as a means of determining personal worth, there was a correspondingly higher rate of property crime. As India enjoyed enormous economic growth, and the overall size of the Indian economy rapidly expanded during the 1990s, the number of available targets for property offenses increased as well. One of the main reasons for the sustained trend in the increase in the number of major criminal offenses may be attributed to a continued increase in the number of violations of legislation such as the \u2018Indian Penal Code\u2019. The other reason may be due to revisions and improvements of the criminal justice system, laws and regulations. The improved regulations represent an attempt to exert more efficient control over India\u2019s increasingly complex society. This social phenomenon is manifested in the rapid expansion of the scope of activities engaged in by the public, together with the various ways in which these activities are pursued as Indian society progresses. Conclusion Trends in crime and the crime rate in India over the past four decades can be summarized as follows. The incidence of crimes fluctuated during that time. One exception to this trend was the crime against human body, which displayed a general pattern of increase. However, it is especially noteworthy that the overall crime rate rose during the 1990s. \u00a0A cross national comparison with USA reveals that overall rates of crime in India were substantially lower than that in the U.S. Compared to the U.S., the overall crime rate of Crime against Human body in India has been relatively high over the past three decades. It is also noteworthy that the crime rates of violent crimes, as well as of property crimes, have all decreased in the U.S. since the early 1990s. But, in comparison between India and U.S, India can consider as the safer place as compare to U.S. According to this study, the overall crime problem in India is not as serious as that in the U.S. However, recent data indicates an alarming increase in the crime rate. From the data analyzed, we can determine that economic, political, and societal factors have played a crucial role in the occurrence of crime and crime control practices in India. Recent phenomena, like the financial crisis and the current political stalemate in India, seem to have contributed to this recent disturbing increase in crime. If these factors can be stabilized, then we may anticipate the improvement of the crime situation in India.

The note contained information from the preliminary results of the UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems for the year 2010, as well as statistics on trends and patterns in intentional homicide and on the topic of the thematic discussion of the twenty-first (2012) session of ccpcj: \u201cViolence against migrants, migrant workers and their families\u201d (see below). It also gave an overview of the methodological challenges in obtaining crime and criminal justice data and in improving their quality.\\\n\\\nThe secretariat found that crime trends across and within regions of the world had diversified. While in Asia, Europe and North America, levels of homicide, robbery, burglary and motor vehicle theft had declined over the preceding years, they had increased in Central America and the Caribbean. A number of driving factors had emerged from the results of crossregional analysis, including the level of economic and social development, State capacity to enforce the rule of law, the presence of organized criminal groups, the use of firearms and the level of gender equality. There was also evidence suggesting that economic trends had a close link with acquisitive crimes, the levels of which could increase in situations of economic stress. The efficiency of criminal justice systems varied depending on the region and the form and level of crime. In particular, there were significant variations of conviction rates and detention patterns, with one reason being the different crime contexts that criminal justice systems had to address. The proportion of prisoners in pretrial detention and indicators of prison overcrowding reflected areas of concern in the administration of justice. Better and deeper analyses of the crime situation and criminal justice systems around the world required better data at the national and international levels. To that end, unodc continued to enhance statistical standards on crime, improve mechanisms for collecting and disseminating data and knowledge of regional and global trends involving certain types of crime, and support countries\u2019 efforts to produce and use statistical data according to international quality standards. The Secretariat recommended that ccpcj encourage Member States to continue participating in the UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems; strengthen its collaboration with the Statistical Commission to support State capacity to produce crime statistics; and acknowledge the establishment of the Centre of Excellence for Statistical Information on Governance, Victims of Crime, Public Security and Justice as a valuable experience to support the efforts of Member States to improve the quality and availability of crime statistics.\\\n\\\n# ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL RESOLUTION\\\n\\\nOn 26\u00a0July [meeting 46], the Economic and Social Council, on the recommendation of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice [E/2012/30 & Corr.1, 2], adopted resolution 2012/18 without vote [agenda item 14 (c)].\\\n\\\n# Improving the quality and availability of statistics on crime and criminal justice for policy development\\\n\\\n# The Economic and Social Council,\\\n\\\nRecalling General Assembly resolution 65/232 of 21\u00a0December 2010, in which the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime was requested to strengthen the collection, analysis and dissemination of accurate, reliable and comparable data and information to enhance knowledge on crime trends and support Member States in designing appropriate responses in specific areas of crime, in particular in their transnational dimension,",

The note contained information from the preliminary results of the UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems for the year 2010, as well as statistics on trends and patterns in intentional homicide and on the topic of the thematic discussion of the twenty-first (2012) session of ccpcj: \u201cViolence against migrants, migrant workers and their families\u201d (see below). It also gave an overview of the methodological challenges in obtaining crime and criminal justice data and in improving their quality. The secretariat found that crime trends across and within regions of the world had diversified. While in Asia, Europe and North America, levels of homicide, robbery, burglary and motor vehicle theft had declined over the preceding years, they had increased in Central America and the Caribbean. A number of driving factors had emerged from the results of crossregional analysis, including the level of economic and social development, State capacity to enforce the rule of law, the presence of organized criminal groups, the use of firearms and the level of gender equality. There was also evidence suggesting that economic trends had a close link with acquisitive crimes, the levels of which could increase in situations of economic stress. The efficiency of criminal justice systems varied depending on the region and the form and level of crime. In particular, there were significant variations of conviction rates and detention patterns, with one reason being the different crime contexts that criminal justice systems had to address. The proportion of prisoners in pretrial detention and indicators of prison overcrowding reflected areas of concern in the administration of justice. Better and deeper analyses of the crime situation and criminal justice systems around the world required better data at the national and international levels. To that end, unodc continued to enhance statistical standards on crime, improve mechanisms for collecting and disseminating data and knowledge of regional and global trends involving certain types of crime, and support countries\u2019 efforts to produce and use statistical data according to international quality standards. The Secretariat recommended that ccpcj encourage Member States to continue participating in the UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems; strengthen its collaboration with the Statistical Commission to support State capacity to produce crime statistics; and acknowledge the establishment of the Centre of Excellence for Statistical Information on Governance, Victims of Crime, Public Security and Justice as a valuable experience to support the efforts of Member States to improve the quality and availability of crime statistics. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL RESOLUTION On 26\u00a0July [meeting 46], the Economic and Social Council, on the recommendation of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice [E/2012/30 & Corr.1, 2], adopted resolution 2012/18 without vote [agenda item 14 (c)]. Improving the quality and availability of statistics on crime and criminal justice for policy development The Economic and Social Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 65/232 of 21\u00a0December 2010, in which the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime was requested to strengthen the collection, analysis and dissemination of accurate, reliable and comparable data and information to enhance knowledge on crime trends and support Member States in designing appropriate responses in specific areas of crime, in particular in their transnational dimension,"

To ensure safe transportation for women, rail and road transport projects like Integrated Emergency Response Management System (IERMS), Video Surveillance System at Konkan Railway, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Facial Recognition System (FRS) integrated with Video surveillance Systems, including Command-and-Control Centre at 7 major railway stations and tabs for safety of women passengers on board the train by Ministry of Railways, and projects like Vehicle Tracking Platform with command and control centre across States/ UTs, and some State specific projects like Uttar Pradesh Road transport Corporation (UPSRTC), Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), etc. by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, have been implemented. Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) has also undertaken several initiatives, which, inter-alia include training and skill development programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers. BPR&D has also prepared Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) for \u2018Women Help Desk at Police Stations\u2019 to ensure their smooth functioning. Emphasis has been laid upon appropriate behavioural and attitudinal skills of the police in course of prevention and detection of crime against women and children and interaction with victims of crime. Webinars on women safety with sensitivity, gender sensitization of police personnel etc. have also been organized by BPR&D. Recognizing the need for psycho-social counselling to women affected by violence and those in distress, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has engaged the services of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) for providing basic and advanced training under the project named \u2018Stree Manoraksha\u2019 to the staff of One Stop Centres (OSCs) across the country on handling psycho-social and mental health care needs of women facing violence and distress. Further, the Ministry of Women and Child Development also administers sub-scheme \u201cSamarthya\u201d under Mission Shakti in which the component of Shakti Sadan is for relief and rehabilitation of women in difficult circumstances. Another component Sakhi Niwas (Working Women\u2019s Hostels) of Mission Shakti provides safe and conveniently located accommodation for working women, with day care facility for their children, wherever possible, in urban, semi urban, or even rural areas where employment opportunities for women exist. The government has also earmarked Rs. 5000 Crore during the current financial year for providing financial assistance to States for establishing working women hostels under the Scheme of Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI). The Government, through institutions like the National Commission for Women (NCW) and its counterparts in States has been spreading awareness through seminars, workshops, audio- visual, print and electronic media etc. to sensitize the people about the safety and security of women and also about various provisions of the legislation and policies etc. In addition, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States/ UTs from time to time on various issues pertaining to safety and security of women. In respect of the registered complaints, NCW takes up the matter with stakeholders especially the Police Authorities to ensure that the complaints are redressed and brought to logical conclusion. This information was given by the Minister of State for Women and Child Development Smt. Savitri Thakur in the Rajya Sabha in reply to a question today. ***** SS/MS (Release ID: 2085607) Read this release in: , , Ministry of Women and Child Development Several steps taken by Government to promote safety, security and empowerment of women Posted On:\n                        18 DEC 2024 3:54PM by PIB Delhi \u2018Police\u2019 and \u2018Public Order\u2019 are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and the responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against women rests with the respective State Governments; they are competent to deal with such crimes. However, the Government gives highest priority to safety and security of women and children and has taken several initiatives in this regard. As per the data reported by NCRB, which is available upto the year 2022 at its website https://ncrb.gov.in/en/crime-india, the number of crimes against women in 2021 and 2022 were 428278 and 445256 respectively. Increased reporting of crime may be attributable to the increased level of awareness among citizens due to various measures taken by government in the last few years including the operationalisation of helplines such as Women Helpline -181 and Emergency Response Support System (ERSS-112), concept of Zero-FIR, e-FIR and provision of institutional support to the survivors. To promote women's empowerment and their safety, government has taken several steps. Some recent laws and policies that directly and indirectly cater to the safety of women are listed below: The Government of India with an aim to modernize and improve the criminal justice system has enacted Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bhartiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) which came into effect from 1st July, 2024. In BNS 2023, the offences against women and children earlier scattered in Indian Penal Code, 1860 have been brought together and consolidated under Chapter-V of BNS. The BNS has introduced new provisions to strengthen laws related to women and children, specifically, Section 111 related to \u201corganized crime\u201d, Section 69 related to sexual intercourse on false promise of marriage, employment, promotion or by suppressing the identity, Section 95 related to hiring, employing or engaging a child to commit an offence etc. In respect of the crimes related to buying a child for the purposes of prostitution (Section 99), gang rape (Section 70) and exploitation of a trafficked person (Section 144), punishment has been increased. Further, in respect of certain severe crimes against women like buying child for the purposes of prostitution (section 99 of BNS), organised crime (Section 111), kidnapping or maiming a child for purpose of begging (Section 139) mandatory minimum punishments have been prescribed. Also, Sections 75 and 79 of BNS 2023 provide additional legal protections against harassment, covering actions like unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks and also word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman. Such a woman facing sexual harassment at workplace has an option to file a complaint under these provisions. Additionally, provisions under section 398 BNSS which introduce Witness Protection Schemes,survivor-centric provisions in recording of statements [Section 176(1), Section 179, Section 193(3) & 195 of BNSS] acknowledging the critical need to shield witnesses from threats and intimidation and Section 2(1)(d) of BSA which now enables electronic or digital record on emails, documents on computers, laptop or smartphone, messages and voice mail messages stored on digital devices under definition of documents can also be referred for protection of women from harassment. Further, the Labour Codes, collectively include provisions to promote participation of women in workforce in a dignified manner and with adequate safety measures adopted by the employers. Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions Code, 2020 consolidates and amends laws regulating the safety, health, and working conditions of workers, with specific provisions to ensure the safety of women at the workplace. The Ministry of Women and Child Development recently launched the SHe-Box portal duly encompassing various provisions of \u2018the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013\u2019 (SH Act). This portal provides a publicly available centralised repository of information related to Internal Committees (ICs) and Local Committees (LCs) formed across the country, whether in government or private sector. It also provides a common platform to file complaints and track the status of such complaints. The portal includes a feature where complaints registered on it will be automatically forwarded to the IC/ LC of the workplaces concerned within the Central Ministries/ Departments, States/ UTs and in Private sector. The portal provides for designating a nodal officer for every workplace who is required to ensure updation of data/ information on a regular basis for real time monitoring of complaints. Under Nirbhaya Fund, Government has taken several measures to improve safety of women at workplace: The component of One Stop Centre (OSCs) under \u2018Sambal\u2019 sub-scheme of \u2018Mission Shakti\u2019, a comprehensive Umbrella Scheme for safety, security and empowerment of women is implemented under the Nirbhaya Fund. The OSCs provide women affected by violence and who are in distress with a range of integrated services under one roof such as Police facilitation, medical aid, providing legal aid and legal counselling, psycho-social counselling, temporary shelter up to 5 days. It is apprised that 802 OSCs have been made functional in 36 States/UTs wherein over 10.12 lakh women have been assisted so far. A fully functional dedicated 24\u00d77\u00d7365 toll-free Women Helpline-181 (WHL) under Nirbhaya Fund is operational in 35 States/UTs except West Bengal, to provide emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence and those in distress across the country. This helpline is fully integrated with 112. To provide help and support to needy women and women in distress, Emergency Response Support System (ERSS-112) has been established in all 36 States and UTs for various emergencies, with computer aided dispatch of field/police resources. So far, Women Helplines have handled over 1.95 crore calls and assisted over 81.64 lakh women. In addition, under Nirbhaya Fund, the Central Government has provided assistance to States/ UTs for setting up/ strengthening Women Help Desks (WHDs) in all police stations. So far, 14658 Women Help Desks have been established in police stations, of which 13,743 are headed by women. A total of 827 Anti-Human Trafficking Units have also been set up for prevention of human trafficking and support to the victims. Cyber Forensic cum Training Labs have also been established in 33 States/UTs with 24,264 person trained in handling cyber related cases. To ensure that justice is delivered to unfortunate women and young girls who are victims of heinous sexual offences, Government has been providing financial assistance to States/ UTs for setting up Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) since 2019. So far, 790 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) have been approved, out of which 750 including 408 exclusive POCSO (e-POCSO) courts are operational in 30 States/UTs, having disposed of more than 2,87,000 cases of rape, and offences under POCSO Act across the country.

Photograph: LUNAE PARRACHO/REUTERS A focus on certain groups such as young males between 10-29 years old can help to reduce violence. Photograph: LUNAE PARRACHO/REUTERS This article is more than 9 years old 24 ways to reduce crime in the world\u2019s most violent cities This article is more than 9 years old Violent crime is deeply entrenched in some developing countries, particularly in Latin America. Our offer these solutions to bringing down high rates Treat violence as a public health concern: We need to use campaigns and technology to reach every child and family in these countries. We need to develop those tools to make sure that everybody feels important and cared for through parenting interventions, family interventions, wellbeing campaigns, and early childhood education. Anilena Mejia, research fellow, , Brisbane, Australia Localise programmes: During the 90s in Rio we had rates of homicide that would go beyond epidemic levels (over 100 per 100,000 citizens). It took a really costly but comprehensive programme in Brazil called to tie up a lot of elements that were drivers of violence in the country, building local frameworks, gun-free zones and fostering civic culture to reduce violence, which has been the case in Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn in Colombia and Santa Tecla in El Salvador. Natasha Leite de Moura, project adviser, public security programme, , Lima, Peru Focus on hotspots: We\u2019ve got scientific evidence that a focus on hotspots and \u2018hot people\u2019 can prevent or reduce violence. But we need also accompany this with other measures \u2013 urban upgrading, better urban planning, situational prevention \u2013 especially early childhood intervention. Robert Muggah, research director of , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the , Canada Look at the whole picture: While people are aware that there are high levels of lethal violence in Brazil, this is often misrepresented by national and international media as a simple cops vs robbers dynamic \u2013 a misrepresentation that more often than not criminalises poverty. Much more work needs to be done on understanding the official and unofficial social, political and economic structures that sustain these high levels. Damian Platt, researcher, activist and , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Create well-targeted programmes: If the goal is to reduce homicides, then programme selection should be located in hotspot areas and focused on the population group most likely to commit violence crimes, often young males between 10-29 years old. The risk factors for why these young men get involved in criminality also needs to be clearly diagnosed and complemented with a treatment plan that involves the family and community. Enrique Roig, director, citizen security, , Washington, DC Focus on prevention: Prison populations are overflowing, crime is high and violence is a culture in South Africa. The focus needs to be on preventing the conditions that draw people into violent or criminal behaviour. In order to do this we need a systematic, integrated, coordinated approach combining the responsibilities of a wide range of state and non-state actors. Venessa Padayachee, national advocacy and lobbying manager, , Cape Town, South Africa Avoid repressive policies: Many countries have approached the problem of violence from a crime and security angle, focusing their action on law-enforcement only. Unfortunate examples of this are the in Central America. While justice and police have an important role to play, repression only is counter-productive if not combined with development interventions that look at the drivers of violence, and tackle things like skills and education of youth, socio-economic inequalities, and access to communal services. Luigi De Martino, senior researcher, , Geneva Be proactive: You have to systematically invest in protective factors. Supporting proactive community associations and schools to activate their involvement has also demonstrated positive results in places such as Cape Town, Chicago and New York. In addition, promoting links between neighbouring communities that adjoin each other is also important. John de Boer, senior policy adviser, , Centre for Policy Research, Tokyo, Japan Don\u2019t forget about male violence: There are lots of interventions that are focused on women\u2019s rights. These are noble. But the vast majority of killings I have seen around the world are by men on men. I think this needs to be addressed. The international community focuses a great deal on the impact of violence against women. If you address the male drivers of violence, you reduce the female harm of violence. Iain Overton, author, , London Officers from the CORE police special forces patrol during an operation to search for fugitives in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images But treat male and female violence as the same issue: Male and female dimensions of violence are connected. We need to look at these issues comprehensively rather than a divide and conquer approach. Research has shown it is not just about single risk factors (i.e. being a male is a risk factor) that determines violence \u2013 rather it is the accumulation of risk factors that produce violence. John de Boer Move away from the focus on poverty: Criminalising certain areas or groups makes it harder for people to actually coexist, and the emphasis on poverty is a misleading one. Latin America proves as long as history of studies that show poverty and violence do not have a direct correlation. Countries are overcoming extreme poverty and becoming more violent, so it is now part of our job to look beyond those solutions and what other factors may be driving those rates. Natasha Leite Focus on gun control: Where there are no guns, there are no gun deaths. A simple and practical way to start impacting armed violence is to try to stem the flow of illegal guns. I believe in the gun control approach as a first step. Iain Overton Understand that violence is going virtual: Cyberspace is a new domain for violence. This ranges from the use of social media to project force (videos showing assassinations, torture, threats), to recruit would-be members of extremist groups (digitally savvy marketing campaigns, online chat sites), for selling product (deep web), and also for more banal but no less important forms of intimidation and coercion (bullying). Violence is going virtual, and we need to get a much better handle on all of this. Robert Muggah Find the balance between repression and prevention: Local experiences and efforts deal mainly with interpersonal aspects of violence. When illicit or transnational crime starts co-opting state forces, people stop trusting their security forces, governments and start focusing on private and personal security, stop using public spaces. So the idea is not create a system based entirely on repression or prevention, but to find that balance and incorporate rehabilitation and reintegration policies and funding into security strategies. Natasha Leite Intervene early: We know that a better understanding of the drivers of violence is essential, and that starting interventions early (childhood - possibly even before kids are born at a pre-natal stage) is crucial. John de Boer Learn from history: A lot of human rights violations of massive proportions in , such as slavery and dictatorship, were never really dealt within a transitional or reconciliation process. At the same time, the security forces are relying on structures that don\u2019t make sense and foster competition and corruption. Natasha Leite Keep in mind the impact of drugs: The global \u201cwar on drugs\u201d is a massive driver of crime, violence and insecurity, not only in the but increasingly globally. It is time for all international anti-violence development initiatives to take this on board. It still amazes me how much taboo there is around this issue, especially regarding the cocaine industry. Damian Platt Target inequality: We need to address economic inequality which I believe is central to reducing crime and violence in the long run. We need universal provision of high quality childcare that is affordable for all, and to narrow the difference between the top-to-bottom earnings and rebuild the link between economic prosperity and wages. Vanessa Padayachee A Brazilian drug gang member nicknamed poses with a gun atop a hill overlooking a slum in Salvador. Photograph: LUNAE PARRACHO/REUTERS Be aware of the link between organised crime and terrorism: My own take on the is that the lines that once separated organised crime from terrorism are increasingly blurred. That does not mean that they are the same actors, nor motivated by the same factors. However, there is an increasing convergence among some gangs and terrorists in terms of their methods. The Zetas have clearly appropriated terrorist tactics to pursue their motives. John de Boer See violence as a priority: One thing that we need to do better at the UN is to better prepare peacekeeping, humanitarian, and development actors to ensure that their interventions reduce violence over the long-term by helping to move key reforms and structural changes forward. One key development would be a measurable and effective target within the SDG process to reduce violence. This needs to be a global priority. John de Boer Raise awareness of improvised explosive devices (IEDs): Countries can be more active in the control of conventional munitions stockpiles, states and international bodies can mitigate the proliferation of IEDs. They can step up the sharing of information on IED events to enhance awareness of the threat and to inform national and international decision making. Luigi de Martino Use non-violent language: In a nation that has a long history of violence, we need to teach non-violence and non-violent communication. In the work I do with young men coming out of gangs, teaching non-violent communication, conflict resolution and basic communication skills has been so powerful. Vanessa Padayachee Remember the details: Too often development programmes are scattered across a wide geographic area and the indicators for success are based on development outcomes and not reducing violence. For example, a workforce development programme to employ young people in a middle-income neighbourhood should be quite different from a workforce development programme targeted at young men who have been in conflict with the law. The latter will require soft skills, cognitive behavioural therapy and trauma counselling in addition to the job component. Enrique Riog Be smart: We believe that targeted investments in income de-concentration, primary and secondary education, early family support, and the rest can prevent violence but not if conducted in a blanket approach. We need to get smarter about how we allocate aid if we want to really have a meaningful impact on preventing and reducing violence. Robert Muggah Read the full Q&A .

That does not mean that they are the same actors, nor motivated by the same factors. However, there is an increasing convergence among some gangs and terrorists in terms of their methods. The Zetas have clearly appropriated terrorist tactics to pursue their motives. John de Boer See violence as a priority: One thing that we need to do better at the UN is to better prepare peacekeeping, humanitarian, and development actors to ensure that their interventions reduce violence over the long-term by helping to move key reforms and structural changes forward. One key development would be a measurable and effective target within the SDG process to reduce violence. This needs to be a global priority. John de Boer Raise awareness of improvised explosive devices (IEDs): Countries can be more active in the control of conventional munitions stockpiles, states and international bodies can mitigate the proliferation of IEDs. They can step up the sharing of information on IED events to enhance awareness of the threat and to inform national and international decision making. Luigi de Martino Use non-violent language: In a nation that has a long history of violence, we need to teach non-violence and non-violent communication. In the work I do with young men coming out of gangs, teaching non-violent communication, conflict resolution and basic communication skills has been so powerful. Vanessa Padayachee Remember the details: Too often development programmes are scattered across a wide geographic area and the indicators for success are based on development outcomes and not reducing violence. For example, a workforce development programme to employ young people in a middle-income neighbourhood should be quite different from a workforce development programme targeted at young men who have been in conflict with the law. The latter will require soft skills, cognitive behavioural therapy and trauma counselling in addition to the job component. Enrique Riog Be smart: We believe that targeted investments in income de-concentration, primary and secondary education, early family support, and the rest can prevent violence but not if conducted in a blanket approach. We need to get smarter about how we allocate aid if we want to really have a meaningful impact on preventing and reducing violence. Robert Muggah Read the full Q&A .

In this way all those activities for which society lays down attached may be sinful but they would not be criminal\nThis constitutes a definition of crime from the social viewpoint. From the legal viewpoint, violation of law constitutes crime. In the words of Barnes and Teeters, \u201cThe term \u201cCrime\u201d technically means a form of anti-social behaviour that has violated public sentiment to such an extent as to be forbidden by statute\u201d.\nThis definition does not include those anti-social activities which are not prohibited by law. Actually, criminality should attach both to anti social activities and to activities forbidden by law. Though no punishment is prescribed for anti-social activities, the public opinion always condemns them. According to Garofalo even the actions contradictory to the prevalent conceptions of pity and truth should be considered criminal. What Are the Major Causes of Crime and How Can Crime Be Prevented: The number of crime being committed in the India is increasing day after day. There are many reasons as to why people commit crimes and it has been identified that there are no quick solutions to fix this problem in the country today. It has been revealed that kids who are being neglected by their parents choose the path of crime later in their lives. The pressure is also a major contributor to crime today. Students who are weak in education and are unable to perform up to the required standards often become criminals in future. Most of these unfortunate kids come from poor backgrounds where the parents are unable to afford for the clothes, books and other necessary things. For the Substance abuse such as drug and alcohol abuse has a strong influence on an ian individual's ability to decide things. When people become addictive, they often commit crime to support their drug habits. Moreover, an addicted person can become a vulnerable target for another criminal due to his inattentiveness. The crime life has been made easier in the India through the easy access of handguns. In most reported cases of crime, the weapon which was used was a handgun which was either stolen or purchased from black markets. This means that unemployment and poverty had caused them to become criminals so that they had means of supporting themselves and their families. Even if they had been employed at some point, the wages obtained from the workplace wouldn't be enough to support a family. With that income it would be impossible to even cater for their basic needs and crime was the only profitable business that could help them in catering for their needs as well as their wants The main cause of crime are \u2013 (1) Social, (2) Economic, (3) Physical and developmental (4) Geographical (5) Political The main social causes of crime are as follows: Family and Crime \u2013 The family is the most dominant factor in the social causes of crime in India.\nNow-a-days family disorganisation is to be seen in India. The control previously exercised by the\nfamily over the individual is now lacking. In urban areas, all the members of a family are to be seen\npursuing their individual paths. With the lifting of family control there are no restrictions to the criminal\ntendencies of children. Now that the natural relations between parents and children are devoid of love\nboth young boys and girls are prone to criminal activity. Even in the villages the adolescents and\nyoung men and women do not respect their elders, and they want to lead a carefree; unrestricted,\nindividual life. Due to all these causes, sex crimes are increasing. One main cause of adultery,\nabortion, miscarriage, prostitution and juvenile delinquency is the undesirable domestic conditions. Absence of Social Control \u2013 A second social cause of crime in India is absence of social control.\nPreviously, the caste panchayats in the village kept control over the behaviour and conduct of the\nmembers of the caste. It was extremely difficult to conceal crime in the village and when any crime\nwas revealed the caste panchayats meted out very stern punishments, going to the limit of\nexterminating the guilty persons from the caste. This tended to control and check crime effectively.\nToday, these social organisations no longer exist. They have been derived of all their authority.\nSecondly, with better facilities of transport being available the criminal can commit the crime and\nabscond from the village to the town of to the village from the town. In urban areas no one is troubled\nabout caste organisation. Now-a-days in big cities, even doing favour to neighbourers is a defunct\npractices because few have intimacy with their neighbourers and social relationships have been\nimpersonal. Any individual can commit a crime and conceal his identity in the city mob. In this way,\nthe disappearance of the control of caste organisations is another cause of crime in India. Defective Education \u2013 Modern education in India is very defective. It does not develop the\ncharacter of students in right directions. Instead it has led to an increase in selfishness, disorderliness\nand impertinence. Ethical and religious education has no place in the modern education system.\nBesides this, even after completing his education an individual does not become capable of earning\nhis livelihood and many well educated people remain unemployed for many years. Late employment\nleads to late marriage. Lack of faith- not believing enough in the power of one's own internal weapons (against inner\ndemons), such as: courage, tolerance, understanding, forgiveness, mercy, honesty, sincerity,\nintegrity, honor, modesty, humbleness, generosity, love, compassion, kindness, detachment,\npatience, self-discipline, temperance, etc. As a result of not trusting inner resources, there is no\nenough motivation to develop them and use them. Art Solutions - get the freecrime cure (the link is\nbelow); watch inspirational films and read inspirational stories of good qualities conquering the bad\nones. Imbalance - most criminals are simply too strong physically, pumping up the body muscles, but not\nenough the mental and emotional muscles. The reason why their strength becomes weakness is\nbecause they are not balanced. Art Therapy Solutions - get the free artistic crime cure (the link is\nbelow); watch the movie trilogy 'Samurai' by legendary Japanese director Hiroshi Inagaki. It tells the\nstory of the greatest Samurai warrior in Japan - Musashi Miyamoto, his journey from being just a\ntough warrior to a true hero, equally strong on all three accounts: physical skills, mental calmness and\nemotional state. Watch all three films online here for free. All these causes tend to aggravate criminal activity: Cinema \u2013 Cinema has helped in the increase of crime in India. According to Blumen and Hansen,\ncinemas indirectly influence the male criminals. The cinema arouses criminal tendencies in men by\nteaching crime techniques, by exhibiting many kinds of crimes, by stimulating the desire for wealth\nand comforts, by showing ways and means of appropriating them illegally, by arousing the feelings of\nbravado, toughness and adventure, by arousing profound sexual urges, by stimulating day dreams of\ncriminal jobs. In much the same way it directs or urges many young and inexperienced women to\nillegitimate relations and crimes by setting alight the sexual desire, the desire for exhibition, love\nmaking, independence and variety. Newspapers \u2013 Besides cinemas, newspapers also have a hand in increasing criminal activity.\nNewspapers increase criminal activity by publishing methods of crime through news items, by printing\nmany news items relating to crime, by making crime a general subject, by printing news of major\ncrimes and showing their advantages, circulating the names of criminals, by highlighting causes which\ntend to increase crime in the name of studies of crime sand by warning and alerting criminals by\npublishing police methods. The recent wave of dacoities in India was to some extent indirectly\nassisted by newspapers. Use of Alcohol \u2013 The consumption of alcohol also is one of the major causes of crime in India.\nDrinking is more prevalent among those who have low standard of life and it is also from among them\nthat the greatest numbers of criminals are coming. There are large numbers of crimes committed\nunder the influence of alcoholic stimulants. Drinking affects not only the drinker and makes him a\ncriminal but it also has a deleterious influence on his entire family and inclines men, women and\nchildren towards crime. In this way, drinking increases crime both apparently as well as indirectly. PROHIBITION of Widow Remarriage \u2013 In India widow remarriage is now legally accepted as valid but\nit is still looked down upon in society. Consequently many young widows do not remarry for the rest of\ntheir lives but such a decision does not annihilate their sexual passion and these rather lie dormant in\na corner of the mind and wait for a suitable opportunity. Even if the widow is religious and saintly she\nis pursued by men and is lured to the path of evil and sin by many threats and coaxes. In this way,\nthere is an increase in adultery, miscarriages, abortions, infanticides, etc. When their sinful practices\nare made public many women commit suicide. Defects of the Marriage and Dowry System \u2013 In India the dowry system also is among the social\ncauses of crime. On the one hand the dowry system urges the fathers of girls to earn money through\nillegitimate means for their daughter\u2019s marriage, it on the other hand, leads to suicide by many young\ngirls who can not bear to see the degraded condition of their parents, the dowry system as further\nencouraged late marriages, both in girls and in boys. In extreme cases, the lack of wealth compels a\ngirl to remain unmarried throughout her life or at most she is married to an old man or to an unsuitable\npartner. All these also tend to increase sex crimes in society. Very often the parents do not care to\nask the girl or boy for opinion and sometimes even proceed against it. This also results in suicide and\nother crimes. Religion \u2013 Religion has also been one of the causes of crime in India. This doe not mean that religion\nitself encouraged crimes but the encouragement has come from the different sects who originated in\nthe differences of opinion between people on matter of religion and in thehatred for other religions. In\na general way, of course, communal riots and crimes such as looting, murder and so on, perpetrated\nin order to increase the followers of one\u2019s own religion and to injure another religion have always been\nhappening in India, but the crimes committed during communal riots in the name of religion, when the\ncountry was partitioned in 1947 were unequalled in the history of the world. Helpless women were\ndenuded and taken in procession through the main roads all the time being whipped. Their breasts\nwere cut off; they were violated and mutilated, their children\u2019s hearts were cut out in front of their\neyes. The most heinous crimes that can be discovered in the history of criminal activity have been\nperpetrated in India. Changes in Social Values \u2013 There has been a tremendous change in social values in recent times in\nIndia. Now-a-days, new notions such as materialism, individualism, rationalism, the respect for\nwealth, absence of sex restriction etc, are becoming very popular in the country. This has led to a\ndisregard of ancient social values and new values have been reinstated in their stead. There is no\none common opinion of any kind in them. This disordered state of values also inspires crime because\nand individual can manage to produce an argument to justify even that which is improper.\nThe preceding exposition on the social causes of crime in India will have brought to light the extent to\nwhich the defects of such social organizations as family, caste, religion, marriage etc, have no\ngeographical, economic, political and other causes but it is intended merely show the important part\nplayed by social organization in crime. Economic Causes The main economic causes of crimes are the following:\n - Poverty \u2013 In India one sees extreme poverty. Poverty is a major cause of crime, since a hungry\nman can do literally anything in order to appease his hunger. One comes across instances where a\ncriminal commits a crime immediately on his release from prison in order that he may be imprisoned\nagain where he is assured of a square meal. Outside the prison he ahs no such assurance. Dr.\nHaikerwal has investigated that in the period 1917 \u2013 1927 thefts increased in number when the prices\nof wheat went up, decreased when wheat prices fell. In this way; a close relation is found to exist\nbetween the number of crimes and the prices of food-grains in India. It was found in the course of a\nstudy conducted upon the prostitutes of Kanpur that one major cause of prostitution is poverty. Poor\ngirls are easily enticed by men who violate them, take away their virginity and put them on the market.\nOne even comes across news of suicides and murders of families due to povery.\n- Unemployment \u2013 Unemployment, much like poverty is a major cause of crime in India. Many young\nmen commit suicides when they are frustrated by extreme poverty and continued unemployment.\nMany others turn to thieving, picking pockets, robbery etc. Among the people who are seen creating\ndisturbances, causing violence, etc; the majority are the unemployed. Most gangsters do not work,\nGangsterism is their only occupation.\n- Industrialisation \u2013 Industrialisation is also an important cause of crime in India. It has destroyed the\nfamily life of millions of labourers. They work very hard for eight to ten hours in the day during which\nthey have to suffer many indecencies and for this they have to live in towns far away from their\nfamilies. Continued existence of this type leads them to indulge in drinking alcohol and in prostitution\nand this encourages other crime. In India, the most prospering centres of prostitution are important\nindustrial towns which, at the same time, foster crimes such as murder, assault, disturbance, robbery,\netc. Industrialisation has encouraged crime also due to another reason. Housing becomes a problem\nin an industrial town when the population increases beyond limits in some towns thousands of families\nlive in houses having no more than one room each. In such conditions the married women have no\nprivacy and children and unmarried members witness happenings which they should not see. This\nhad a bad influence upon them and sex crimes increase among them. Sex crimes increase\ntendencies to other crimes which then take place. In industrial towns many thousands of labourers\nand men otherwise are compelled to live alone and this tends to split the ration of men to women,\nwhich consequently encourages sex crimes. Many girls from rural areas are deceived with promises\nof employment and brought to towns where they are forced to adopt prostitution.\n- Urbanization \u2013 Urbanization is the result of industrialization and other causes. Hence all those\ncrimes caused by industrialization are also caused by urbanization. In cities the society fails to\nexercise control over the individual who loses his identity in the mob after having committed a crime.\nThere is no such facility, however redoubtable in the village. In towns there are better opportunities for\npicking pockets and practising deception in a crowd. There is absence of healthy recreation in the\ntown and hence the crimes are committed. Gambling dens, indecent theatres and wine shops provide\nmeans of spurious recreation. This encourages crime.\nIt is evident from the foregoing account of the socio-economic causes of crime in India that there the\nmain causes of crime is social and economic.\nAbsence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to say definitely that the causes of crime here are hardly\npsychological. But what can be said is that since life in India still lacks some of the velocity and\ncrowdedness of Western life, the psychological causes of crime in India do not compare favourably\nwith their counterparts in America and other Western countries. PREVENTATION OF CRIME IN INDIA. Defination of situational prevention and preventation of crime in India? Situational prevention comprises opportunity-reducing measures that (1) are directed at highly\nspecific forms of crime, (2) involve the management, design or manipulation of the immediate\nenvironment in as systematic and permanent way as possible, (3) make crime more difficult and risky,\nor less rewarding and excusable as judged by a wide range of offenders. Several features of the\ndefinition relevant to the more extended discussion of situational crime prevention below should be\nnoted. First, it makes clear that situational measures must be tailored to highly specific categories of\ncrime, which means that distinctions must be made, not between broad categories such as burglary\nand robbery, but rather between the different kinds of offenses falling under each of these categories. The Four Components of Situational Crime Prevention As mentioned, much existing activity falling under the definition of situational crime prevention\nrepresents problem-solving undertaken by managers in a variety of public and private agencies. In\nsome instances, mistakes might have been avoided and less time taken to develop solutions had\nthose involved been familiar with the elements of situational prevention. A choice approactheoretical foundation drawing principally upon routine activity and rational. A standard methodology based on the action research paradigm, A set of opportunity-reducing techniques, and A body of evaluated practice including studies of displacement. The Action Research Methodology The standard methodology for a situational project, situational prevention's second component, is a\nversion of the action research model in which researchers and practitioners work together to analyze\nand define the problem, to identify and try out possible solutions, to evaluate the results and, if\nnecessary, to repeat the cycle until success is achieved. As mentioned, this is essentially the same\nproblem The influence of the action research paradigm can be seen in the following specification of\nthe five stages of a situational prevention project : 1. collection of data about the nature and dimensions of the specific crime problem; 2. analysis of the situational conditions that permit or facilitate the commission of the crime in\nquestion. 3. systematic study of possible means of blocking opportunities for these particular crimes, including\nanalysis of costs. 4. implementation of the most promisingproblem-oriented policing as well as in many other forms of\nsocial intervention, andbecause of its extensive pedigree has required little modification for use in\nsituational crime preventation. Crime prevention is the attempt to reduce victimization and to deter crime and criminals. It is applied\nspecifically to efforts made by governments to reduce crime, enforce the law, and maintain criminal\njustice.\nThey agree that governments must go beyond law enforcement and criminal justice to tackle the risk\nfactors that cause crime because it is more cost effective and leads to greater social benefits than the\nstandard ways of responding to crime. Interestingly, multiple opinion polls also confirm public support\nfor investment in prevention. Waller uses these materials in Less Law, More Order to propose specific\nmeasures to reduce crime as well as a crime\nSome of the highlights of these authorities are set out below with some sources for further\nreading.Risk factors that cause crime\n - Create, implement and monitor a national action plan for violence prevention.\n- Enhance capacity for collecting data on violence.\n- Define priorities for, and support research on, the causes, consequences, costs and\nprevention of violence.\n- Promote primary prevention responses.\n- Strengthen responses for victims of violence.\n- Integrate violence prevention into social and educational policies, and thereby promote\ngender and social equality.\n- Increase collaboration and exchange of information on violence prevention.\n- Promote and monitor adherence to international treaties, laws and other mechanisms to\nprotect human rights.\n- Seek practical, internationally agreed responses to the global drugs and global arms trade.\nprevention - There are plenty of people out there contemplating illegal or immoral acts, who\nshould be prevented to act on it. Playing on their fear of punishment works for most, but is not enough for the others. - Social\nwelfare is one of the greatest contra-measures to keep unemployed individuals from resorting to\ndesperate means in order to keep a head above water. Sports provide a good outlet for young men and perhaps keeps them out of trouble. Art Therapy is another outlet that additionally provides a a sense of higher truth, a frame for the\nsearch for identity, a journey from the stressful reality to a transcendental world of pure penetration\nand splendor, means for helping us to cope with life's afflictions and paradoxes that could\nempower and inspire us to better our lives, find something powerful and special that easily deals\nwith pessimism, distrust and lack of meaning...just to name a few. Converting - to convert a criminal into a honorable citizen it takes more than implementing fear of\npunishment. Arts can do wonders in transforming any individual, including criminals. Talidari's\ntriple action transition formula used in the crime cure 'Jump' uses the power of inspiration to\nstimulate criminals to make a jump to the right side. Reformation - remodeling the system (educational, economic, jurisdiction...) that breeds criminals\nis a core necessity. There is a saying telling that if you want to change others, start by changing\nyourself. Everything is related and we all are in a way responsible for the way our world is. By\ntransforming the causes (one of which is the system) we can both prevent and reduce crime. Punishment - No doubt, every person who harms another should be punished, but also\nrehabilitated so that the crime is prevented from reoccurring. Punishment is good for two reasons:\nit shows the offender that one can not get away with doing the wrong things, and as a form of\nprevention - the fear of punishment is often (but not often enough) main reason for law-abiding\ncitizens not to slip to the other side of the tracks. However, the question is how severe the\npunishment should be.\nA sentence that is longer than 2 years can have contra-effective results, apart from the cost for us taxpayers. Coming out after too many years being locked has proven to be more difficult to re-\nintegrate and make it out there, and more easy to resort back to crime. Investing in improving the system instead of in accommodating prisoners seems more effective long-term. Crime and Punishment and Its Correlation. Why do we need laws? how do laws impact our society and human nature? Do we follow laws\nbecause we are afraid of consequences or because we are moral? If laws are the solution to crime,\nthen why is that there is not a crime free society?\nThese are the standard questions anyone would ask when they read any crime report or any law\nenforcement article on the newspaper. In this presentation I ve tried to collect answers for the above\nquestions through my topic CRIME and PUNISHMENT and correlate them to get a better idea on my\ntopic.\n - Laws don't impact our human nature, they just create a barrier around it. Our human nature is\njust like any other animal: eat, sleep, kill, reproduce. Without laws, we will regress back into our\nanimal instincts and kill one another to get what we want.\n- Laws impact society by creating order. It would be more accurate to say that society is created\nby having laws in place as opposed to it being impacted by laws.\n- Without laws, society cannot exist. The laws can be understood or written, but the must be\nthere in order to have a society.We need laws in society so our society can regulate and work\nproperly.\n- They are designed to protect us and our property and to ensure that everyone in society\nbehaves the way that the community expects them too. Without laws there would be complete\nanarchy. Accordingly, efforts to decrease and reduce crime were targeted at the rehabilitation or moral\nre-orientation of the criminal: that is, to take away his or her motivation and incentive to commit\na crime.\nCriminal eventscease to have much significance in themselves and become,\ninstead,symptomatic manifestations of underlying criminal dispositions' . CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BASED SOCIETY In a society based on laws, crime and punishment are serious topics. Crime is present in every form\nin this world and for every crime the law has a punishment; the law has formulated a punishment to\ncontrol the crime rates in the society.The crimes might be drug trafficking,gunrunning,moneylaundering,extortion,murder,fraud,homicide,robbery,poaching,assault.With\neach new crime that pops up, another method of detection is developed; and with each new crime\nthat pops up, another means of protecting yourself comes to light. Punishments and imprisonments are already in place to decrease crime levels. Another way is to\nreduce the opportunities of crime for the criminals. This can be achieved by better lighting, improved\nsecurity systems, locking bars and guard dogs. Moreover, if people are given proper education then there will be an automatic reduction in crime rate\nas they will be able to get a job which will be able to provide for their basic needs and wants. There\nare also treatment programs available which influences people to make positive choices and refrain\nfrom criminal activities. Show More",

Now-a-days in big cities, even doing favour to neighbourers is a defunct\n                        practices because few have intimacy with their neighbourers and social relationships have been\n                        impersonal. Any individual can commit a crime and conceal his identity in the city mob. In this way,\n                        the disappearance of the control of caste organisations is another cause of crime in India. Defective Education \u2013 Modern education in India is very defective. It does not develop the\n                        character of students in right directions. Instead it has led to an increase in selfishness, disorderliness\n                        and impertinence. Ethical and religious education has no place in the modern education system.\n                        Besides this, even after completing his education an individual does not become capable of earning\n                        his livelihood and many well educated people remain unemployed for many years. Late employment\n                        leads to late marriage. Lack of faith- not believing enough in the power of one's own internal weapons (against inner\n                        demons), such as: courage, tolerance, understanding, forgiveness, mercy, honesty, sincerity,\n                        integrity, honor, modesty, humbleness, generosity, love, compassion, kindness, detachment,\n                        patience, self-discipline, temperance, etc. As a result of not trusting inner resources, there is no\n                        enough motivation to develop them and use them.

The reason why their strength becomes weakness is\n                        because they are not balanced.

According to Blumen and Hansen,\n                        cinemas indirectly influence the male criminals. The cinema arouses criminal tendencies in men by\n                        teaching crime techniques, by exhibiting many kinds of crimes, by stimulating the desire for wealth\n                        and comforts, by showing ways and means of appropriating them illegally, by arousing the feelings of\n                        bravado, toughness and adventure, by arousing profound sexual urges, by stimulating day dreams of\n                        criminal jobs. In much the same way it directs or urges many young and inexperienced women to\n                        illegitimate relations and crimes by setting alight the sexual desire, the desire for exhibition, love\n                        making, independence and variety. Newspapers \u2013 Besides cinemas, newspapers also have a hand in increasing criminal activity.\n                        Newspapers increase criminal activity by publishing methods of crime through news items, by printing\n                        many news items relating to crime, by making crime a general subject, by printing news of major\n                        crimes and showing their advantages, circulating the names of criminals, by highlighting causes which\n                        tend to increase crime in the name of studies of crime sand by warning and alerting criminals by\n                        publishing police methods. The recent wave of dacoities in India was to some extent indirectly\n                        assisted by newspapers. Use of Alcohol \u2013 The consumption of alcohol also is one of the major causes of crime in India.\n                        Drinking is more prevalent among those who have low standard of life and it is also from among them\n                        that the greatest numbers of criminals are coming. There are large numbers of crimes committed\n                        under the influence of alcoholic stimulants. Drinking affects not only the drinker and makes him a\n                        criminal but it also has a deleterious influence on his entire family and inclines men, women and\n                        children towards crime. In this way, drinking increases crime both apparently as well as indirectly. PROHIBITION of Widow Remarriage \u2013 In India widow remarriage is now legally accepted as valid but\n                        it is still looked down upon in society. Consequently many young widows do not remarry for the rest of\n                        their lives but such a decision does not annihilate their sexual passion and these rather lie dormant in\n                        a corner of the mind and wait for a suitable opportunity. Even if the widow is religious and saintly she\n                        is pursued by men and is lured to the path of evil and sin by many threats and coaxes. In this way,\n                        there is an increase in adultery, miscarriages, abortions, infanticides, etc. When their sinful practices\n                        are made public many women commit suicide. Defects of the Marriage and Dowry System \u2013 In India the dowry system also is among the social\n                        causes of crime. On the one hand the dowry system urges the fathers of girls to earn money through\n                        illegitimate means for their daughter\u2019s marriage, it on the other hand, leads to suicide by many young\n                        girls who can not bear to see the degraded condition of their parents, the dowry system as further\n                        encouraged late marriages, both in girls and in boys. In extreme cases, the lack of wealth compels a\n                        girl to remain unmarried throughout her life or at most she is married to an old man or to an unsuitable\n                        partner. All these also tend to increase sex crimes in society. Very often the parents do not care to\n                        ask the girl or boy for opinion and sometimes even proceed against it. This also results in suicide and\n                        other crimes. Religion \u2013 Religion has also been one of the causes of crime in India. This doe not mean that religion\n                        itself encouraged crimes but the encouragement has come from the different sects who originated in\n                        the differences of opinion between people on matter of religion and in thehatred for other religions. In\n                        a general way, of course, communal riots and crimes such as looting, murder and so on, perpetrated\n                        in order to increase the followers of one\u2019s own religion and to injure another religion have always been\n                        happening in India, but the crimes committed during communal riots in the name of religion, when the\n                        country was partitioned in 1947 were unequalled in the history of the world. Helpless women were\n                        denuded and taken in procession through the main roads all the time being whipped. Their breasts\n                        were cut off; they were violated and mutilated, their children\u2019s hearts were cut out in front of their\n                        eyes. The most heinous crimes that can be discovered in the history of criminal activity have been\n                        perpetrated in India. Changes in Social Values \u2013 There has been a tremendous change in social values in recent times in\n                        India. Now-a-days, new notions such as materialism, individualism, rationalism, the respect for\n                        wealth, absence of sex restriction etc, are becoming very popular in the country. This has led to a\n                        disregard of ancient social values and new values have been reinstated in their stead. There is no\n                        one common opinion of any kind in them. This disordered state of values also inspires crime because\n                        and individual can manage to produce an argument to justify even that which is improper.\n                        The preceding exposition on the social causes of crime in India will have brought to light the extent to\n                        which the defects of such social organizations as family, caste, religion, marriage etc, have no\n                        geographical, economic, political and other causes but it is intended merely show the important part\n                        played by social organization in crime. Economic Causes The main economic causes of crimes are the following: Poverty \u2013 In India one sees extreme poverty. Poverty is a major cause of crime, since a hungry\n                        man can do literally anything in order to appease his hunger. One comes across instances where a\n                        criminal commits a crime immediately on his release from prison in order that he may be imprisoned\n                        again where he is assured of a square meal. Outside the prison he ahs no such assurance. Dr.\n                        Haikerwal has investigated that in the period 1917 \u2013 1927 thefts increased in number when the prices\n                        of wheat went up, decreased when wheat prices fell. In this way; a close relation is found to exist\n                        between the number of crimes and the prices of food-grains in India. It was found in the course of a\n                        study conducted upon the prostitutes of Kanpur that one major cause of prostitution is poverty. Poor\n                        girls are easily enticed by men who violate them, take away their virginity and put them on the market.\n                        One even comes across news of suicides and murders of families due to povery. Unemployment \u2013 Unemployment, much like poverty is a major cause of crime in India. Many young\n                        men commit suicides when they are frustrated by extreme poverty and continued unemployment.\n                        Many others turn to thieving, picking pockets, robbery etc. Among the people who are seen creating\n                        disturbances, causing violence, etc; the majority are the unemployed. Most gangsters do not work,\n                        Gangsterism is their only occupation. Industrialisation \u2013 Industrialisation is also an important cause of crime in India. It has destroyed the\n                        family life of millions of labourers. They work very hard for eight to ten hours in the day during which\n                        they have to suffer many indecencies and for this they have to live in towns far away from their\n                        families. Continued existence of this type leads them to indulge in drinking alcohol and in prostitution\n                        and this encourages other crime. In India, the most prospering centres of prostitution are important\n                        industrial towns which, at the same time, foster crimes such as murder, assault, disturbance, robbery,\n                        etc. Industrialisation has encouraged crime also due to another reason. Housing becomes a problem\n                        in an industrial town when the population increases beyond limits in some towns thousands of families\n                        live in houses having no more than one room each. In such conditions the married women have no\n                        privacy and children and unmarried members witness happenings which they should not see. This\n                        had a bad influence upon them and sex crimes increase among them. Sex crimes increase\n                        tendencies to other crimes which then take place. In industrial towns many thousands of labourers\n                        and men otherwise are compelled to live alone and this tends to split the ration of men to women,\n                        which consequently encourages sex crimes. Many girls from rural areas are deceived with promises\n                        of employment and brought to towns where they are forced to adopt prostitution. Urbanization \u2013 Urbanization is the result of industrialization and other causes. Hence all those\n                        crimes caused by industrialization are also caused by urbanization. In cities the society fails to\n                        exercise control over the individual who loses his identity in the mob after having committed a crime.\n                        There is no such facility, however redoubtable in the village. In towns there are better opportunities for\n                        picking pockets and practising deception in a crowd. There is absence of healthy recreation in the\n                        town and hence the crimes are committed. Gambling dens, indecent theatres and wine shops provide\n                        means of spurious recreation. This encourages crime.\n                        It is evident from the foregoing account of the socio-economic causes of crime in India that there the\n                        main causes of crime is social and economic.\n                        Absence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to say definitely that the causes of crime here are hardly\n                        psychological. But what can be said is that since life in India still lacks some of the velocity and\n                        crowdedness of Western life, the psychological causes of crime in India do not compare favourably\n                        with their counterparts in America and other Western countries. PREVENTATION OF CRIME IN INDIA. Defination of situational prevention and preventation of crime in India? Situational prevention comprises opportunity-reducing measures that (1) are directed at highly\n                    specific forms of crime, (2) involve the management, design or manipulation of the immediate\n                    environment in as systematic and permanent way as possible, (3) make crime more difficult and risky,\n                    or less rewarding and excusable as judged by a wide range of offenders. Several features of the\n                    definition relevant to the more extended discussion of situational crime prevention below should be\n                    noted. First, it makes clear that situational measures must be tailored to highly specific categories of\n                    crime, which means that distinctions must be made, not between broad categories such as burglary\n                    and robbery, but rather between the different kinds of offenses falling under each of these categories. The Four Components of Situational Crime Prevention As mentioned, much existing activity falling under the definition of situational crime prevention\n                    represents problem-solving undertaken by managers in a variety of public and private agencies. In\n                    some instances, mistakes might have been avoided and less time taken to develop solutions had\n                    those involved been familiar with the elements of situational prevention. A choice approactheoretical foundation drawing principally upon routine activity and rational. A standard methodology based on the action research paradigm, A set of opportunity-reducing techniques, and A body of evaluated practice including studies of displacement. The Action Research Methodology The standard methodology for a situational project, situational prevention's second component, is a\n                    version of the action research model in which researchers and practitioners work together to analyze\n                    and define the problem, to identify and try out possible solutions, to evaluate the results and, if\n                    necessary, to repeat the cycle until success is achieved. As mentioned, this is essentially the same\n                    problem The influence of the action research paradigm can be seen in the following specification of\n                    the five stages of a situational prevention project : 1. collection of data about the nature and dimensions of the specific crime problem; 2. analysis of the situational conditions that permit or facilitate the commission of the crime in\n                    question. 3. systematic study of possible means of blocking opportunities for these particular crimes, including\n                    analysis of costs. 4. implementation of the most promisingproblem-oriented policing as well as in many other forms of\n                    social intervention, andbecause of its extensive pedigree has required little modification for use in\n                    situational crime preventation. Crime prevention is the attempt to reduce victimization and to deter crime and criminals. It is applied\n                    specifically to efforts made by governments to reduce crime, enforce the law, and maintain criminal\n                    justice.\n                    They agree that governments must go beyond law enforcement and criminal justice to tackle the risk\n                    factors that cause crime because it is more cost effective and leads to greater social benefits than the\n                    standard ways of responding to crime. Interestingly, multiple opinion polls also confirm public support\n                    for investment in prevention. Waller uses these materials in Less Law, More Order to propose specific\n                    measures to reduce crime as well as a crime\n                    Some of the highlights of these authorities are set out below with some sources for further\n                    reading.Risk factors that cause crime Create, implement and monitor a national action plan for violence prevention. Enhance capacity for collecting data on violence. Define priorities for, and support research on, the causes, consequences, costs and\n                        prevention of violence. Promote primary prevention responses. Strengthen responses for victims of violence. Integrate violence prevention into social and educational policies, and thereby promote\n                        gender and social equality. Increase collaboration and exchange of information on violence prevention. Promote and monitor adherence to international treaties, laws and other mechanisms to\n                        protect human rights. Seek practical, internationally agreed responses to the global drugs and global arms trade.\n                        prevention - There are plenty of people out there contemplating illegal or immoral acts, who\n                        should be prevented to act on it. Playing on their fear of punishment works for most, but is not enough for the others. - Social\n                    welfare is one of the greatest contra-measures to keep unemployed individuals from resorting to\n                    desperate means in order to keep a head above water. Sports provide a good outlet for young men and perhaps keeps them out of trouble. Art Therapy is another outlet that additionally provides a a sense of higher truth, a frame for the\n                    search for identity, a journey from the stressful reality to a transcendental world of pure penetration\n                    and splendor, means for helping us to cope with life's afflictions and paradoxes that could\n                    empower and inspire us to better our lives, find something powerful and special that easily deals\n                    with pessimism, distrust and lack of meaning...just to name a few. Converting - to convert a criminal into a honorable citizen it takes more than implementing fear of\n                    punishment. Arts can do wonders in transforming any individual, including criminals. Talidari's\n                    triple action transition formula used in the crime cure 'Jump' uses the power of inspiration to\n                    stimulate criminals to make a jump to the right side. Reformation - remodeling the system (educational, economic, jurisdiction...) that breeds criminals\n                    is a core necessity. There is a saying telling that if you want to change others, start by changing\n                    yourself. Everything is related and we all are in a way responsible for the way our world is. By\n                    transforming the causes (one of which is the system) we can both prevent and reduce crime. Punishment - No doubt, every person who harms another should be punished, but also\n                    rehabilitated so that the crime is prevented from reoccurring. Punishment is good for two reasons:\n                    it shows the offender that one can not get away with doing the wrong things, and as a form of\n                    prevention - the fear of punishment is often (but not often enough) main reason for law-abiding\n                    citizens not to slip to the other side of the tracks. However, the question is how severe the\n                    punishment should be.\n                    A sentence that is longer than 2 years can have contra-effective results, apart from the cost for us\n\n                    taxpayers. Coming out after too many years being locked has proven to be more difficult to re-\n                    integrate and make it out there, and more easy to resort back to crime. Investing in improving the\n\n                    system instead of in accommodating prisoners seems more effective long-term. Crime and Punishment and Its Correlation. Why do we need laws? how do laws impact our society and human nature? Do we follow laws\n                    because we are afraid of consequences or because we are moral? If laws are the solution to crime,\n                    then why is that there is not a crime free society?\n                    These are the standard questions anyone would ask when they read any crime report or any law\n                    enforcement article on the newspaper. In this presentation I ve tried to collect answers for the above\n                    questions through my topic CRIME and PUNISHMENT and correlate them to get a better idea on my\n                    topic. Laws don't impact our human nature, they just create a barrier around it. Our human nature is\n                        just like any other animal: eat, sleep, kill, reproduce. Without laws, we will regress back into our\n                        animal instincts and kill one another to get what we want. Laws impact society by creating order. It would be more accurate to say that society is created\n                        by having laws in place as opposed to it being impacted by laws. Without laws, society cannot exist. The laws can be understood or written, but the must be\n                        there in order to have a society.We need laws in society so our society can regulate and work\n                        properly. They are designed to protect us and our property and to ensure that everyone in society\n                        behaves the way that the community expects them too. Without laws there would be complete\n                        anarchy. Accordingly, efforts to decrease and reduce crime were targeted at the rehabilitation or moral\n                    re-orientation of the criminal: that is, to take away his or her motivation and incentive to commit\n                    a crime.\n                    Criminal eventscease to have much significance in themselves and become,\n                    instead,symptomatic manifestations of underlying criminal dispositions' . CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BASED SOCIETY In a society based on laws, crime and punishment are serious topics. Crime is present in every form\n                    in this world and for every crime the law has a punishment; the law has formulated a punishment to\n                    control the crime rates in the society.The crimes might be drug\n\n                    trafficking,gunrunning,moneylaundering,extortion,murder,fraud,homicide,robbery,poaching,assault.With\n                    each new crime that pops up, another method of detection is developed; and with each new crime\n                    that pops up, another means of protecting yourself comes to light. Punishments and imprisonments are already in place to decrease crime levels. Another way is to\n                    reduce the opportunities of crime for the criminals. This can be achieved by better lighting, improved\n                    security systems, locking bars and guard dogs. Moreover, if people are given proper education then there will be an automatic reduction in crime rate\n                    as they will be able to get a job which will be able to provide for their basic needs and wants. There\n                    are also treatment programs available which influences people to make positive choices and refrain\n                    from criminal activities. Show More"

We at the Urban Institute\u2019s propose five additional evidence-based strategies based on our own research: . Drug courts, which combine judicial supervision with substance abuse treatment, are rapidly gaining popularity as a tool to combat crime and drug use. Based on a five-year study, we found that people who took part in drug courts had lower relapse rates and committed fewer additional crimes, such as selling drugs and driving while intoxicated. Forty-nine percent of drug court participants reported committing new crimes, compared with 64 percent of non-participants. . By vastly improving our ability to identify and arrest suspects, .

In Chicago, every dollar spent on cameras yielded over $4 in savings in court costs, incarceration, and pain and suffering associated with prevented crimes. Cameras are most effective when there are a sufficient number of them and they are monitored by trained staff. . Access to stable housing can dramatically reduce crime committed by former prisoners. Our evaluation of the Returning Home-Ohio (RHO) program found that released prisoners who were connected to housing services were 60 percent less likely to return to prison.

        "markdown": "Context: According to the annual report of the (NCRB) released, crimes against women rose 4% in 2022 compared to 2021. About Crimes Against Women The United Nations defines a crime against women as \u201cany act of gender-based violence that results in or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. NCRB: Nature of Crime against Women The report said 4,45,256 cases of crime against women were registered in 2022, an increase of 4% compared to 4,28,278 in 2021. The majority of crimes against women were of cruelty by husband or his relatives (31.4%) followed by: kidnapping and abduction of women (19.2%), assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty (18.7%), and rape (7.1%). Further, 13,479 cases were registered under the Dowry Prohibition Act. The high crime rate is an indicator of the persistent \u201clower status and inequality\u201d faced by women and girls. The NCRB\u2019s report reveals that over 4.45 lakh cases of crimes against women were registered in 2022, equivalent to nearly 51 FIRs (first information report) every hour. The rate of crimes against women per lakh population stood at 66.4 while the filing of charge sheets in such cases was pegged at 75.8. State/UTs crime rate: With 14,247 cases in 2022, Delhi recorded the highest rate of crimes against women in the country at 144.4 per lakh, way above the country\u2019s average rate of 66.4. Uttar Pradesh (65,743) registered the maximum FIRs in cases of crimes against women in 2022, followed by Maharashtra (45,331), Rajasthan (45,058), West Bengal (34,738), and Madhya Pradesh (32,765). These five states together contributed to 2,23, 635 (or 50.2 percent) of the total cases lodged in India last year, according to the NCRB. A total of 12 States and Union Territories recorded crime rates higher than the national average of 66.4. Delhi topped the list at 144.4 followed by Haryana (118.7), Telangana (117), Rajasthan (115.1), Odisha (103), Andhra Pradesh (96.2), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (93.7), Kerala (82), Assam (81), Madhya Pradesh (78.8), Uttarakhand (77), Maharashtra (75.1), and West Bengal (71.8). The rate of crime in Uttar Pradesh\u2014which alone contributed nearly 15 percent of the cases in India\u2014stood at 58.6, according to the NCRB. What are the Reasons for the Increase in crimes against women? Regressive Value system: Women and girls continue to be treated as permanent shock absorbers across class, caste, and other axes. Patriarchal Mindset: It is an outcome of the reconstruction of patriarchy in the neo-liberal economy era. Unchanged Behaviour: Despite high levels of education, male mindsets and societal attitudes remain unchanged. Gender-Based Violence: Practices like child marriage, female genital mutilation, honor killings, and dowry violence increased gender-based violence and Crime against Women. Proper implementation of laws: Lack of proper implementation of laws is one of the main factors responsible for increased crimes against women. Even though there are numerous laws to deal with the crimes against women happening in society the crimes are still rising. Economic dependent: Women are generally economically dependent on men due to various factors, they are not given a free hand in education, jobs, etc. less wages are paid to them as compared to men for the same work. COVID-19 impact: As the COVID-19 pandemic deepens economic and social stress coupled with restricted movement and social isolation measures, gender-based violence is increasing exponentially. Many women are being forced to \u2018lockdown\u2019 at home with their abusers at the same time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible. Provisions related to women\u2019s Safety in India Constitutional: The Constitution of India not only grants equality to women but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favor of women to neutralize the cumulative socio-economic, educational, and political disadvantages faced by them. Fundamental Rights, among others, ensure equality before the law and equal protection of the law; prohibit discrimination against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth, and guarantee equality of opportunity to all citizens in matters relating to employment. Articles 14, 15, 15(3), 16, 39(a), 39(b), 39(c) and 42 of the Constitution are of specific importance in this regard. Legal: The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986. National Policy on Women\u2019s Safety: An Action Plan has been furnished by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, which covers legal and schematic interventions to enhance the safety of Women. Government Initiative: The Government has set up the Nirbhaya Fund for projects for the safety and security of women. MHA launched an online analytic tool for police on 19th February 2019 called \u201cInvestigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences\u201d to monitor and track time-bound investigations in sexual assault cases by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2018. MHA launched the \u201cNational Database on Sexual Offenders\u201d (NDSO) on 20th September 2018 to facilitate the investigation and tracking of sexual offenders across the country by law enforcement agencies. NDSO has data on over 5 lakh sexual offenders. Emergency Response Support System, which provides a single emergency number (112) based computer-aided dispatch of field resources to the location of distress has been operationalized in 20 States/ UTs in 2018-19. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has also introduced the scheme of One Stop Centres to provide integrated support and assistance to women affected by violence and a Scheme for Universalisation of Women Helpline to provide 24-hour emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence. Global Effort to Reduce Crime Against Women Two international agreements are upheld for woman\u2019s right to live free from violence such as: The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: On 18 December 1979, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. It entered into force as an international treaty on 3 September 1981 after the twentieth country had ratified it. The 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women: It is issued by the UN General Assembly, defines violence against women as \u201cany act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats. Challenges faced in law implementation Lack of skilled officers: There is a severe lack of police officers with requisite training for investigations. Most of the investigating officers are juniors with a poor pay scale. This hampers the actual investigation and preparation of chargesheets. Delay in Justice: When it reaches the courts, at trial courts which are the first step, the cases take four to five years. If there is an appeal, it takes another 10-15 years. Low representation of women: According to a response provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in the Rajya Sabha in February 2023, the representation of women in the police force (as of January 1, 2022) remained at 11.7% of the total state police force. This puts undue stress on the limited workforce leading to a high pendency. Fast-track courts: Despite fast-track courts for looking into grievous crimes, they remain as slow as regular courts. At 19%, Delhi\u2019s FTSCs \u2014 16 in number \u2014 have among the lowest disposal rates in the country, going by data from the Ministry of Law and Justice. Way forward Addressing root causes: Public awareness campaigns and educational programs must actively deconstruct harmful gender stereotypes and promote positive masculinity. Empower women economically: Increased economic independence can give women more agency and reduce their vulnerability to abuse. Investing in women\u2019s education and skill development is crucial. Fast-track court system : Enhance the efficiency of fast-track courts by appointing more judges, streamlining procedures, and providing adequate infrastructure. Reduce social stigma: Encourage public campaigns to counter victim blaming and create a supportive environment where women feel safe to come forward and report crimes. Also Read : Shares: Search",

Can we take a pledge to get rid of this in our behaviour,\" he suggested, urging people to \" to get rid of everything that humiliates women in everyday life\". This was not the first time Mr Modi had talked about gender equality and respect for women. In his first Independence Day speech as prime minister in 2014, saying \"when we hear about these rapes, our heads hang in shame\". After eight years under his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, data shows that crimes against women remain unabated. The numbers show a consistent year-on-year rise, except in 2020 - the year when the Covid-19 pandemic swept India and a hard lockdown forced the country to shut down for months. Experts say it also impacted data collection. In the year 2021 - for which the government released crime data last week - India recorded the highest number of crimes against women ever. Activists say the rising graph is a matter of serious concern, but authorities say it's because there's better reporting now and more people are going to the police to register cases. We mined the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports for the past six years to distil the data about crimes against women and here's what we found, in five charts. The rising graph Of the six million crimes that police in India recorded between 1 January and 31 December last year, 428,278 cases involved crimes against women. It's a rise of 26.35% over six years - from 338,954 cases in 2016. A majority of the cases in 2021, the report said, were of kidnappings and abduction, rapes, domestic violence, dowry deaths and assaults. Also, 107 women were attacked with acid, 1,580 women were trafficked, 15 girls were sold and 2,668 women were victims of cybercrimes. With more than 56,000 cases, the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which is India's most populous with 240 million people, once again topped the list. It was followed by Rajasthan with 40,738 cases and Maharashtra with 39,526 cases. The rape capital Last year, police recorded 31,878 rapes - the numbers show a steep rise from the previous year (28,153), but compared to the 39,068 women who were raped in 2016, they show a decline of 18%. With tens of thousands of rape cases reported annually, India has earned the moniker \"the rape capital of the world\". It's not because India is an exception - many countries report equal or higher numbers of rapes. But critics say the world's largest democracy gets a bad name because of the way the victims and survivors are treated - they are , and often too. Most recently, a Muslim woman who was gang-raped and saw 14 members of her family killed by Hindu neighbours during the 2002 Gujarat riots \" after her rapists were freed from jail. The story of the unfair treatment Bilkis Bano received made global headlines, reinforcing the view that India is often unkind to its women. Taken away The latest data records 76,263 kidnappings and abductions of women - up 14% from 66,544 in 2016. Some of the crime was linked to murder, ransom and many were trafficked for prostitution and domestic work. But a large majority of the kidnapped women - 28,222 - were taken away to \"compel her for marriage\". Experts say many of these cases are false and are filed by families of women who elope with their lovers despite parental disapproval. The enemy at home Violence inside the home is mostly recorded under the legal term of \"cruelty by husband or his relatives\" and it has consistently been the most reported violent crime against women in India. In 2021, police received complaints from 137,956 women - which breaks down to about one every four minutes. It's an increase of 27% from 2016 when 110,434 women sought police help. Such violence is not unique to India - the World Health Organization says one in three women globally face gender-based violence and the numbers for India are similar. But what sets it apart here is the silence that surrounds to, even approval for violence at home. More than 40% women and 38% men told a recent government survey that if she disrespected her in-laws, neglected her home or children, went out without telling him, refused sex or didn't cook properly. No happily ever after Even though India outlawed dowries in 1961, the centuries-old tradition of the bride's family gifting cash, gold and other expensive items to the groom's family remains rampant. , dowry was paid in 95% of marriages in rural India. Campaigners say new brides are often harassed for not bringing in sufficient dowry and thousands are killed by their husbands and in-laws every year. Most are burnt to death and the murders are passed off as \"kitchen accidents\". In 1983, India introduced a tough new law - Section 498A - to curb dowry deaths, but thousands of brides continue to be murdered every year. Last year, police recorded 6,795 dowry deaths - or on average, one every 77 minutes. The numbers are a 10.92% improvement over 2016 when police registered 7,628 dowry deaths.

        "markdown": "What is cybercrime? How to protect yourself What is cybercrime? Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device. Most cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money. However, occasionally cybercrime aims to damage computers or networks for reasons other than profit. These could be political or personal. Cybercrime can be carried out by individuals or organizations. Some cybercriminals are organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers. What are the types of cybercrime? Types of cybercrime include: Email and internet fraud. Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used). Theft of financial or card payment data. Theft and sale of corporate data. Cyberextortion (demanding money to prevent a threatened attack). attacks (a type of cyberextortion). (where hackers mine cryptocurrency using resources they do not own). Cyberespionage (where hackers access government or company data). Interfering with systems in a way that compromises a network. Infringing copyright. Illegal gambling. Selling illegal items online. Soliciting, producing, or possessing child pornography. Cybercrime involves one or both of the following: Criminal activity targeting computers using viruses and other . Criminal activity using computers to commit other crimes. Cybercriminals that target computers may infect them with malware to damage devices or stop them working. They may also use malware to delete or steal data. Or cybercriminals may stop users from using a website or network or prevent a business providing a software service to its customers, which is called a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Cybercrime that uses computers to commit other crimes may involve using computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information or illegal images. Cybercriminals are often doing both at once. They may target computers with viruses first and then use them to spread malware to other machines or throughout a network. Some jurisdictions recognize a third category of cybercrime which is where a computer is used as an accessory to crime. An example of this is using a computer to store stolen data. Examples of cybercrime Here are some famous examples of different types of cybercrime attack used by cybercriminals: 1. Malware attacks A malware attack is where a computer system or network is infected with a computer virus or other type of malware. A computer compromised by malware could be used by cybercriminals for several purposes. These include stealing confidential data, using the computer to carry out other criminal acts, or causing damage to data. A famous example of a malware attack was the WannaCry ransomware attack, a global cybercrime committed in May 2017. WannaCry is a type of ransomware, malware used to extort money by holding the victim\u2019s data or device to ransom. The ransomware targeted a vulnerability in computers running Microsoft Windows. When the WannaCry ransomware attack hit, 230,000 computers were affected across 150 countries. Users were locked out of their files and sent a message demanding that they pay a ransom to regain access. Worldwide, the WannaCry cybercrime is estimated to have caused $4 billion in financial losses. To this day, the attack stands out for its sheer size and impact. 2. Phishing A campaign is when spam emails, or other forms of communication, are sent with the intention of tricking recipients into doing something that undermines their security. Phishing campaign messages may contain infected attachments or links to malicious sites, or they may ask the receiver to respond with confidential information. A famous example of a phishing scam took place during the World Cup in 2018.\u00a0According to our report, , the World Cup phishing scam involved emails that were sent to football fans. These spam emails tried to entice fans with fake free trips to Moscow, where the World Cup was being hosted. People who opened and clicked on the links contained in these emails had their personal data stolen. Another type of phishing campaign is known as . These are targeted phishing campaigns which try to trick specific individuals into jeopardizing the security of the organization they work for. Unlike mass phishing campaigns, which are very general in style, spear-phishing messages are typically crafted to look like messages from a trusted source. For example, they are made to look like they have come from the CEO or the IT manager. They may not contain any visual clues that they are fake. 3. Distributed DoS attacks are a type of cybercrime attack that cybercriminals use to bring down a system or network. Sometimes connected IoT (Internet of Things) devices are used to launch DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack overwhelms a system by using one of the standard communication protocols it uses to spam the system with connection requests. Cybercriminals who are carrying out cyberextortion may use the threat of a DDoS attack to demand money. Alternatively, a DDoS may be used as a distraction tactic while another type of cybercrime takes place. A famous example of this type of attack is the . This brought the lottery\u2019s website and mobile app offline, preventing UK citizens from playing. The reason behind the attack remains unknown, however, it is suspected that the attack was an attempt to blackmail the National Lottery.

Attacks on companies affect individuals too since many of them store sensitive data and personal information from customers. A single attack \u2013 whether it\u2019s a data breach, malware, ransomware or DDoS attack - costs companies of all sizes an average of $200,000, and many affected companies go out of business within six months of the attack, according to . Javelin Strategy & Research published an which found that identity fraud losses for the year totalled $56 billion. For both individuals and companies, the impact of cybercrime can be profound \u2013 primarily financial damage, but also loss of trust and reputational damage.

Here are some sensible tips to protect your computer and your personal data from cybercrime: 1. Keep software and operating system updated Keeping your software and operating system up to date ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches to protect your computer. 2. Use anti-virus software and keep it updated Using anti-virus or a comprehensive internet security solution like is a smart way to protect your system from attacks. Anti-virus software allows you to scan, detect and remove threats before they become a problem. Having this protection in place helps to protect your computer and your data from cybercrime, giving you piece of mind. Keep your antivirus updated to receive the best level of protection. 3. Use strong passwords Be sure to use that people will not guess and do not record them anywhere. Or use a reputable password manager to generate strong passwords randomly to make this easier. 4. Never open attachments in spam emails A classic way that computers get infected by malware attacks and other forms of cybercrime is via email attachments in spam emails. Never open an attachment from a sender you do not know. 5. Do not click on links in spam emails or untrusted websites Another way people become victims of cybercrime is by clicking on links in spam emails or other messages, or unfamiliar websites. Avoid doing this to stay safe online. 6. Do not give out personal information unless secure Never give out personal data over the phone or via email unless you are completely sure the line or email is secure. Make certain that you are speaking to the person you think you are. 7. Contact companies directly about suspicious requests If you are asked for personal information or data from a company who has called you, hang up. Call them back using the number on their official website to ensure you are speaking to them and not a cybercriminal.\u00a0Ideally, use a different phone because cybercriminals can hold the line open. When you think you\u2019ve re-dialed, they can pretend to be from the bank or other organization that you think you are speaking to. 8. Be mindful of which website URLs you visit Keep an eye on the URLs you are clicking on. Do they look legitimate? Avoid clicking on links with unfamiliar or URLs that look like spam. If your internet security product includes functionality to secure online transactions, ensure it is enabled before carrying out financial transactions online. 9. Keep an eye on your bank statements Spotting that you have become a victim of cybercrime quickly is important. Keep an eye on your bank statements and query any unfamiliar transactions with the bank. The bank can investigate whether they are fraudulent. A good antivirus will protect you from the threat of cybercrime. Further reading: Related videos: Special Offer Get 10% off !

Here are some sensible tips to protect your computer and your personal data from cybercrime: 1. Keep software and operating system updated Keeping your software and operating system up to date ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches to protect your computer. 2. Use anti-virus software and keep it updated Using anti-virus or a comprehensive internet security solution like is a smart way to protect your system from attacks. Anti-virus software allows you to scan, detect and remove threats before they become a problem. Having this protection in place helps to protect your computer and your data from cybercrime, giving you piece of mind. Keep your antivirus updated to receive the best level of protection. 3. Use strong passwords Be sure to use that people will not guess and do not record them anywhere. Or use a reputable password manager to generate strong passwords randomly to make this easier. 4. Never open attachments in spam emails A classic way that computers get infected by malware attacks and other forms of cybercrime is via email attachments in spam emails. Never open an attachment from a sender you do not know. 5. Do not click on links in spam emails or untrusted websites Another way people become victims of cybercrime is by clicking on links in spam emails or other messages, or unfamiliar websites. Avoid doing this to stay safe online. 6. Do not give out personal information unless secure Never give out personal data over the phone or via email unless you are completely sure the line or email is secure. Make certain that you are speaking to the person you think you are. 7. Contact companies directly about suspicious requests If you are asked for personal information or data from a company who has called you, hang up. Call them back using the number on their official website to ensure you are speaking to them and not a cybercriminal.\u00a0Ideally, use a different phone because cybercriminals can hold the line open. When you think you\u2019ve re-dialed, they can pretend to be from the bank or other organization that you think you are speaking to. 8. Be mindful of which website URLs you visit Keep an eye on the URLs you are clicking on. Do they look legitimate? Avoid clicking on links with unfamiliar or URLs that look like spam. If your internet security product includes functionality to secure online transactions, ensure it is enabled before carrying out financial transactions online. 9. Keep an eye on your bank statements Spotting that you have become a victim of cybercrime quickly is important. Keep an eye on your bank statements and query any unfamiliar transactions with the bank. The bank can investigate whether they are fraudulent. A good antivirus will protect you from the threat of cybercrime. Further reading: Related videos: Special Offer Get 10% off !

Crime prevention is defined as \u201cthe anticipation, the recognition, and the appraisal of a crime risk and the initiation of action to remove or reduce it.\u201d The first step in crime prevention is to realize that in order to prevent crime or becoming a crime victim we must accept that crime prevention is a shared responsibility. It is not a college problem or a police problem. It is a societal problem that can only be properly addressed by the entire campus community. On a college campus that includes, students, faculty, staff, visitors and neighbors. Therefore, campus safety is truly a shared responsibility. Three elements must be present for a crime to occur; desire, ability and opportunity. This is also known as the crime triangle. A person may \u201cwant\u201d to commit a crime, and have the \u201cability\u201d to commit a crime, but if we deny them the \u201copportunity\u201d, then no crime can be committed. Historically, the primary goal of crime prevention has been to apprehend criminals. Although this goal is still important, the goal of preventing crime and also reducing the cost of crime has taken on significant importance. Our goal is to help individuals prevent crime by helping them make decisions in their everyday lives to reduce the opportunity for crime to occur, whether on campus or not. Colleges and universities throughout the United States and the world are very concerned about providing campus settings that are safe and secure. As a result, most colleges and universities have established security and police departments that provide a wide array of security and police services and educational and prevention programs. Understanding campus crime prevention and how you can personally increase your chances of having a safe and enjoyable college experience will mutually benefit you and your campus. Know how to contact Public Safety or the police Know the emergency telephone number for your campus Public Safety (292-2911) or police department (911). Keep the emergency phone numbers near your phones (stickers, magnets, etc.). Program emergency phone numbers into your personal cell phone. Learn where the campus emergency telephones (blue light telephones) are located on campus and learn how to use them. Insure that you are subscribed to the campus mass notification system (MCC Alert). Participate in any campus emergency other safety programs being offered. Walking around campus Familiarize yourself with the layout of the campus. Survey the campus while classes are in session and after dark to see that academic buildings, walkways, facilities, and parking lots are adequately secured and well-lighted. Plan the safest route to your destination; choose well-lit, busy pathways and streets. Share your class schedule with your parents and trusted friends and give them your telephone numbers. At night, stick to well-lit areas whenever possible and avoid alleyways or \u201cshort cuts\u201d through isolated areas. Travel in groups, and avoid going out alone at night. Use the campus escort service at night. Know where the emergency call boxes are located on campus and learn how to use them. If you are being followed, change direction and go to the nearest business or home; knock on the door, and request that someone call the police. Note the description of the person following you. Walk near the curb and avoid shrubbery or other places of potential concealment. Tell a friend or roommate where you are going and what time you expect to return. Stay alert to your surroundings and the people around you. Carry your purse close to your body and keep a firm grip on it; carry your wallet in an inside coat pocket or your front pant pocket. Keep your keys separate from your purse or backpack. Don\u2019t overload yourself with bags or packages and avoid wearing shoes that restrict your movements. Walk with a confident stride; keep your head up and look around. If a motorist stops and asks for directions, keep your distance from the car. In the residence halls Always lock your door; even when you\u2019re sleeping or just going down the hall. Do not allow strangers to enter your room or your complex. Do not open your door unless you can identify the person seeking entry. Do not let unknown individuals \u201ctailgate\u201d; ask who they are visiting and offer to call Public Safety. Do not prop any exterior doors open to allow unescorted visitors into the residence hall (pizza delivery, friends, etc.). Report lost or stolen residence hall keys immediately to your residence hall staff. Report any malfunctioning locks, doors or windows to your Residence Life staff. Do not leave your keys lying around in your room when you are not in the room. Do not leave messages on your door about when you will be returning to your room. Tell a roommate or friend if you are planning to be away overnight or for a few days. Report any suspicious persons or activities (including solicitors) in or near your residence hall to your residence hall staff, Public Safety or police. Secure your valuables and engrave expensive items with identifying information. Always lock your doors and windows at night, especially if you reside on the first or second floors. Do not leave your identification, keys, wallets, checkbooks, or other valuables in open view. Get to know your RA, Residence Life staff and neighbors. Motor vehicle safety Park in well lighted areas, where your vehicle is visible; avoid parking next to vans or trucks. Keep all items out of sight, especially valuables. Service your vehicle regularly to avoid breakdowns. Keep your vehicle locked at all times. When leaving your car for service, remove your other keys. Have your key ready when you approach your car. Before getting in, check inside and under your car to make sure no one is hiding. Bicycle safety and protection Use a bike light when riding a bicycle at night. Wear a helmet at all times when riding a bicycle. Obey all traffic laws; you must stop at intersections; pedestrians have the right of way. Pay attention to your surroundings; warn pedestrians when you are passing them. Take extra care when passing parking lot exits or driving through parking lots. Give proper hand signals when turning or stopping. Before leaving a lane, give a hand signal. Leave the lane only when safe to do so. Secure your bicycle with a heavy duty U-lock or chain. When possible, lock at least your front wheel and frame to a bike rack or other stationary object. Do not park your bicycle in a doorway, on stairs, or blocking any handicapped access. Use a bike rack. Engrave or permanently mark your bicycle with an identifying number and record that number with Public Safety or the police. On Foot Avoid dark, vacant, or deserted areas; use well-lit routes. Avoid walking/jogging/running alone, especially at night. Ask a friend to go with you. Call Public Safety to accompany you around campus during evening hours. Dress in clothes and shoes that will not hamper movement. Be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times. Avoid wearing headsets that impair your ability to detect and respond to potentially dangerous situations. Report suspicious activity or noises immediately. Carry a noise-making device with you at all times, and use it if you suspect you are in danger. Move to a lit area or building and raise a commotion. Call 911 or activate a blue light emergency phone in the event of an emergency. If you sense trouble: Move away from the potential threat if possible; cross the street and increase your pace. Join a group of people nearby. If a threatening situation is imminent and people are close by, yell, scream or do whatever you can to get their attention. Remember, dialing 911 and or/activating a fire alarm are both part of the personal safety system. 911 calls are free from most pay phones, and blue light emergency phones are usually located in many areas on campus and simply require a push of a button to notify emergency services of your situation. If you are facing an armed criminal, you may minimize the risk of injury to yourself if you comply with the criminal's demands. However, if your life is in immediate danger, use any defense you can to get away. Dial 911 immediately and give a description of the suspect Automatic teller machines Try to use ATMs during daylight hours. If you must go at night, do not go alone. Avoid ATMs that are not well lit or clearly visible from the street. Be aware of people loitering or sitting in cars around ATMs. Prepare your transaction ahead of time. Do not spend much time at the machine. Do not give out your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to anyone! Many thieves will attempt to steal your PIN number by calling you on the phone and claiming they are the police, security officers, or bank officers. Memorize it and do not keep a written copy of it in your wallet. Either keep your ATM receipt or tear it up and throw it away. Protecting yourself from identity theft Destroy private records and statements. Destroy credit card statements, solicitations and other documents that contain any private information. Shred this paperwork using a \"cross-cut\" shredder so thieves can't find your data when they rummage through your garbage. Also, don't leave a paper trail; never leave ATM, credit card or gas station receipts behind. Secure your mail. Empty your mailbox quickly, lock it or get a P.O. Box so criminals don't have a chance to steal credit card offers. Never mail outgoing bill payments and checks from an unsecured mailbox, especially at home. They can be stolen from your mailbox and the payee's name erased with solvents. Mail them from the post office or another secure location. Safeguard your Social Security number. Never carry your card with you, or any other card that may have your number, like a health insurance card or school issued ID. Don't put your number on your checks; your SSN is the primary target for identity thieves because it gives them access to your credit report and bank accounts. There are very few entities that can actually demand your SSN - the Department of Motor Vehicles, for example. Also, SSNs are required for transactions involving taxes, so that means banks, brokerages, employers, and the like also have a legitimate need for your SSN. Safeguard your computer. Protect your computer from viruses and spies. Use complicated passwords; frequently update antivirus software and spyware. Surf the Web cautiously. Shop only at trustworthy web sites and be wary of obscure sites or any site you've never used before. Know who you're dealing with. Whenever you are contacted, either by phone or email, by individuals identifying themselves as banks, credit card or e-commerce companies and asked for private identity or financial information, do not respond. Legitimate companies do not contact you and ask you to provide personal data such as PINs, user names and passwords or bank account information over the phone or Internet. If you think the request is legitimate, contact the company yourself by calling customer service using the number on your account statement or in the telephone book and confirm what you were told before revealing any of your personal data. Take your name off marketers' hit lists. In addition to the national Do Not Call Registry (1-888-382-1222 or ), you also can reduce credit card solicitations for five years by contacting an opt-out service run by the three major credit bureaus: (888) 5-OPT OUT or . You'll need to provide your Social Security number as an identifier. Guard your personal information. Ask questions whenever anyone asks you for personal data. How will the information be used? Why must I provide this data? Ask anyone who does require your Social Security number, for instance, cell phone providers, what their privacy policy is and whether you can arrange for the organization not to share your information with anyone else. Monitor your credit report. Each year, obtain and thoroughly review your credit report from the three major credit bureaus; Equifax (800-685-1111), Experian (883-397-3742) and TransUnion (800-680-4213) or at ) to look for suspicious activity. If you spot something, alert your card company or the creditor immediately. Review your bank and credit card statements carefully. Look for unauthorized charges or withdrawals and report them immediately. Make sure you recognize the merchants, locations and purchases listed before paying the bill. If you don't need or use department store or bank-issued credit cards, consider closing the accounts. Keep track of your billing dates/cycles and follow up with creditors if you don\u2019t receive bills/statements on time. Use random letters and numbers for passwords; don\u2019t use your mother\u2019s maiden name, your birth date, your graduation date, your social security number or any other familiar letters or numbers that can be associated with you as passwords. Be aware of how ID thieves can get your information. They get information from businesses or other institutions by stealing records, bribing employees with access to records, hacking into computers, rummaging through trash, posing as a landlord, employer, or someone else who may have a legal right to the information, stealing credit and debit card numbers as your card is processed by using a special information storage device (\"skimming\"), stealing wallets and purses containing identification and credit or bank cards, stealing mail, including bank and credit card statements, pre-approved credit offers, new checks, or tax information or completing a \"change of address form\" to divert your mail to another location. If your identity is stolen: Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus. Tell them that you're an identity theft victim. Request that a \"fraud alert\" be placed in your file, along with a victim's statement asking that creditors call you before opening any new accounts or changing your existing accounts. Equifax To report fraud: 1-800-525-6285 (P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241), Experian To report fraud: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742) (P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013), and TransUnion To report fraud: 1-800-680-7289 (Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92634) Contact the creditors for any accounts that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. Speak with someone in the security/fraud department of each creditor, and follow up with a letter. If your Social Security number has been used illegally, contact the Social Security Fraud Hotline at 1-800-269-0271. File a report with Public Safety or the police in the community where the identity theft took place. Get a copy of the police report in case the bank, credit-card company, or others need proof of the crime. Keep records of everything involved in your efforts to clear up fraud, including copies of written correspondence and records of telephone calls. Computer scams Computer phishing is a crime. Phishers attempt to fraudulently acquire credit card details and other sensitive personal data via bogus email or pop-up windows. It may look like a legitimate email from a legitimate institution, but beware of unsolicited requests for information. Financial or payment institutions will never request that you send them personal sensitive data via email or pop up windows. If you receive a suspicious looking email from any bank, lending, or payment institution, it is best to delete and not respond. If, by coincidence, you have an account with the entity mentioned in the email, call your legitimate institution using the number on your physical bill or via the telephone book or through telephone information. Do not call the number that may be listed in the bogus email and do not click on any link listed in the bogus email Using public transportation Try to avoid isolated bus or train stops and times when few people are around. Stay away from the curb until bus/train arrives. Have the exact fare or ticket/pass ready as you board the bus. If possible, sit near the driver and notify him or her of any problems. A crowded bus is a prime target for pick pockets; carry your bags close and carry your wallet in your coat or front pant pocket. If someone is bothering or harassing you, move to another seat location and/or tell the person in a loud voice to \u201cSTAY AWAY\u201d. Don\u2019t fall asleep on a bus or shuttle. Remain on the bus/train if you are uncomfortable with getting off. Theft protection When leaving your dorm room, home, or office, lock doors and windows even if you will be gone for \"just a minute.\" Never leave your purse, wallet, or valuables exposed; store them out of sight. Be especially careful with your credit cards, which are very popular items among thieves because they are usually easy to steal and then use again. Consider obtaining a credit card with your photo imprinted on it. Computers, especially if they are portable, are primary targets of theft. Consider the purchase of a locking security or tracking device. Contact Public Safety to borrow engravers; engrave computers, stereos, and televisions with your driver's license number (including home state) or department name. Do not engrave on removable serial number plates. Keep a list of all items and serial numbers in a safe place. Never prop open a locked door. Vandalism and graffiti Report all vandalism and graffiti immediately. In addition to being illegal and costly, much vandalism and graffiti may also be bias, hate or gang related. Safety at work If you\u2019re working late, let someone know where you are and how long you expect to be; or better yet, plan in advance to have a co-worker stay with you. Keep your purse or wallet locked in a drawer or filing cabinet at all times. Politely ask strangers who they are visiting and offer to help find the person; if you are suspicious of the person contact Public Safety or the police. Keep emergency phone numbers posted near your phone. Know your office emergency evacuation plan. Be cautious if using restrooms, elevators or stairwells that are isolated or poorly lit; or go with a friend. Keep money, checkbooks, or other valuable items out of sight. Report any suspicious, threatening or alarming behavior of others to your supervisor or Public Safety/police immediately. Do not loan your office keys to anyone and report lost or stolen keys immediately to your supervisor and the security/police department. Active Threat (Workplace/Campus Violence) If you are involved in a situation where someone has entered the area and started shooting; the following are a list of actions that are recommended: If possible exit the building/area immediately, but only if it can be done safely. Notify anyone you may encounter to exit the building immediately. Notify Public Safety or police if safe to use phone. Give the following information: Your name Your phone number Location of the incident (be as specific as possible) Number of shooters Identification of shooter Number of persons who may be involved Your location If exiting the building/area is not possible, the following actions are recommended: Go to the nearest room or office. Close and lock the door. If unable to lock the door, use a wedge device or heavy furniture to block the door; a belt or other objects may be able to wedge the door shut. Cover the door windows. Depending upon the shooters location, exit out the window quietly and quickly if possible and safe to do so. Stay low, move away from the door, keep quiet and act as if no one is in the room. Do not answer the door. Notify Public Safety or police. Provide information as needed. Wait for the police to assist your exit from the building: Follow all instructions by police officers Police may not know if the shooter is hiding among you, therefore police may search you and your belongings for everyone's safety. If you are trapped with the shooter, you need to decide whether to: Stay still and play dead. Run for an exit, or Attack the shooter. Online safety Never give personal information to people that you don\u2019t know (name, home address, phone number, etc.). If you decide to talk to someone on the phone don\u2019t give out your number; call them and use caller ID block. Use a nickname in chat rooms or message boards. Meet chat friends in public places and with other friends; take a cell phone with you. Never go to someone\u2019s room, apartment or house that you just met. Holiday security If you leave campus during school holidays store your bicycle with Student Housing. If you leave your car on campus find out where you are supposed to park it and remove all valuables from it. Place valuables that you cannot take with you out of sight in your room/apartment/home and unplug all appliances before you leave. Park your car in a well-lit location and leave your keys and contact information with a trusted friend. If you stay on campus during holidays or the summer be alert to any suspicious persons around the residence halls, bike racks, or parking lots. Call Public Safety or the Police immediately to report any unusual activity. Studying or traveling abroad Gain as much information as possible about the county that you will be traveling to. Visit (Inoculation Requirements) Check your medical health insurance coverage. Make two extra copies of all your travel information (passport, airline tickets, etc.); leave one set at home with a relative or close friend and take a copy with you. Know your credit card limits. Make certain that a trusted family member is aware of the location of all your legal papers; legal will, insurance documents, mortgage information, internet/cell phone passwords, etc. Leave valuable or expensive looking jewelry at home. Do not bring large amounts of cash; use traveler\u2019s checks or credit cards. Take a list of all important telephone numbers (family, U.S. Embassy and Consulate, campus emergency numbers). When you arrive, secure a copy of your important information in a safe and secure location. Bring an extra pair of prescription glasses. Pack your medical prescriptions in their original containers. Mark all luggage on the inside and outside with your name, address and telephone number; if possible cover your outside luggage tags.",

Shred this paperwork using a \"cross-cut\" shredder so thieves can't find your data when they rummage through your garbage. Also, don't leave a paper trail; never leave ATM, credit card or gas station receipts behind. Secure your mail. Empty your mailbox quickly, lock it or get a P.O. Box so criminals don't have a chance to steal credit card offers. Never mail outgoing bill payments and checks from an unsecured mailbox, especially at home. They can be stolen from your mailbox and the payee's name erased with solvents. Mail them from the post office or another secure location. Safeguard your Social Security number. Never carry your card with you, or any other card that may have your number, like a health insurance card or school issued ID. Don't put your number on your checks; your SSN is the primary target for identity thieves because it gives them access to your credit report and bank accounts. There are very few entities that can actually demand your SSN - the Department of Motor Vehicles, for example. Also, SSNs are required for transactions involving taxes, so that means banks, brokerages, employers, and the like also have a legitimate need for your SSN. Safeguard your computer. Protect your computer from viruses and spies. Use complicated passwords; frequently update antivirus software and spyware. Surf the Web cautiously. Shop only at trustworthy web sites and be wary of obscure sites or any site you've never used before. Know who you're dealing with. Whenever you are contacted, either by phone or email, by individuals identifying themselves as banks, credit card or e-commerce companies and asked for private identity or financial information, do not respond. Legitimate companies do not contact you and ask you to provide personal data such as PINs, user names and passwords or bank account information over the phone or Internet. If you think the request is legitimate, contact the company yourself by calling customer service using the number on your account statement or in the telephone book and confirm what you were told before revealing any of your personal data. Take your name off marketers' hit lists. In addition to the national Do Not Call Registry (1-888-382-1222 or ), you also can reduce credit card solicitations for five years by contacting an opt-out service run by the three major credit bureaus: (888) 5-OPT OUT or . You'll need to provide your Social Security number as an identifier. Guard your personal information. Ask questions whenever anyone asks you for personal data. How will the information be used? Why must I provide this data? Ask anyone who does require your Social Security number, for instance, cell phone providers, what their privacy policy is and whether you can arrange for the organization not to share your information with anyone else. Monitor your credit report. Each year, obtain and thoroughly review your credit report from the three major credit bureaus; Equifax (800-685-1111), Experian (883-397-3742) and TransUnion (800-680-4213) or at ) to look for suspicious activity. If you spot something, alert your card company or the creditor immediately. Review your bank and credit card statements carefully. Look for unauthorized charges or withdrawals and report them immediately. Make sure you recognize the merchants, locations and purchases listed before paying the bill. If you don't need or use department store or bank-issued credit cards, consider closing the accounts. Keep track of your billing dates/cycles and follow up with creditors if you don\u2019t receive bills/statements on time. Use random letters and numbers for passwords; don\u2019t use your mother\u2019s maiden name, your birth date, your graduation date, your social security number or any other familiar letters or numbers that can be associated with you as passwords. Be aware of how ID thieves can get your information. They get information from businesses or other institutions by stealing records, bribing employees with access to records, hacking into computers, rummaging through trash, posing as a landlord, employer, or someone else who may have a legal right to the information, stealing credit and debit card numbers as your card is processed by using a special information storage device (\"skimming\"), stealing wallets and purses containing identification and credit or bank cards, stealing mail, including bank and credit card statements, pre-approved credit offers, new checks, or tax information or completing a \"change of address form\" to divert your mail to another location. If your identity is stolen: Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus. Tell them that you're an identity theft victim. Request that a \"fraud alert\" be placed in your file, along with a victim's statement asking that creditors call you before opening any new accounts or changing your existing accounts. Equifax To report fraud: 1-800-525-6285 (P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241), Experian To report fraud: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742) (P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013), and TransUnion To report fraud: 1-800-680-7289 (Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92634) Contact the creditors for any accounts that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. Speak with someone in the security/fraud department of each creditor, and follow up with a letter. If your Social Security number has been used illegally, contact the Social Security Fraud Hotline at 1-800-269-0271. File a report with Public Safety or the police in the community where the identity theft took place. Get a copy of the police report in case the bank, credit-card company, or others need proof of the crime. Keep records of everything involved in your efforts to clear up fraud, including copies of written correspondence and records of telephone calls. Computer scams Computer phishing is a crime. Phishers attempt to fraudulently acquire credit card details and other sensitive personal data via bogus email or pop-up windows. It may look like a legitimate email from a legitimate institution, but beware of unsolicited requests for information. Financial or payment institutions will never request that you send them personal sensitive data via email or pop up windows. If you receive a suspicious looking email from any bank, lending, or payment institution, it is best to delete and not respond. If, by coincidence, you have an account with the entity mentioned in the email, call your legitimate institution using the number on your physical bill or via the telephone book or through telephone information. Do not call the number that may be listed in the bogus email and do not click on any link listed in the bogus email Using public transportation Try to avoid isolated bus or train stops and times when few people are around. Stay away from the curb until bus/train arrives. Have the exact fare or ticket/pass ready as you board the bus. If possible, sit near the driver and notify him or her of any problems. A crowded bus is a prime target for pick pockets; carry your bags close and carry your wallet in your coat or front pant pocket. If someone is bothering or harassing you, move to another seat location and/or tell the person in a loud voice to \u201cSTAY AWAY\u201d. Don\u2019t fall asleep on a bus or shuttle. Remain on the bus/train if you are uncomfortable with getting off. Theft protection When leaving your dorm room, home, or office, lock doors and windows even if you will be gone for \"just a minute.\" Never leave your purse, wallet, or valuables exposed; store them out of sight. Be especially careful with your credit cards, which are very popular items among thieves because they are usually easy to steal and then use again. Consider obtaining a credit card with your photo imprinted on it. Computers, especially if they are portable, are primary targets of theft. Consider the purchase of a locking security or tracking device. Contact Public Safety to borrow engravers; engrave computers, stereos, and televisions with your driver's license number (including home state) or department name. Do not engrave on removable serial number plates. Keep a list of all items and serial numbers in a safe place. Never prop open a locked door. Vandalism and graffiti Report all vandalism and graffiti immediately. In addition to being illegal and costly, much vandalism and graffiti may also be bias, hate or gang related. Safety at work If you\u2019re working late, let someone know where you are and how long you expect to be; or better yet, plan in advance to have a co-worker stay with you. Keep your purse or wallet locked in a drawer or filing cabinet at all times. Politely ask strangers who they are visiting and offer to help find the person; if you are suspicious of the person contact Public Safety or the police. Keep emergency phone numbers posted near your phone. Know your office emergency evacuation plan. Be cautious if using restrooms, elevators or stairwells that are isolated or poorly lit; or go with a friend. Keep money, checkbooks, or other valuable items out of sight. Report any suspicious, threatening or alarming behavior of others to your supervisor or Public Safety/police immediately. Do not loan your office keys to anyone and report lost or stolen keys immediately to your supervisor and the security/police department. Active Threat (Workplace/Campus Violence) If you are involved in a situation where someone has entered the area and started shooting; the following are a list of actions that are recommended: If possible exit the building/area immediately, but only if it can be done safely. Notify anyone you may encounter to exit the building immediately. Notify Public Safety or police if safe to use phone. Give the following information: Your name Your phone number Location of the incident (be as specific as possible) Number of shooters Identification of shooter Number of persons who may be involved Your location If exiting the building/area is not possible, the following actions are recommended: Go to the nearest room or office. Close and lock the door. If unable to lock the door, use a wedge device or heavy furniture to block the door; a belt or other objects may be able to wedge the door shut. Cover the door windows. Depending upon the shooters location, exit out the window quietly and quickly if possible and safe to do so. Stay low, move away from the door, keep quiet and act as if no one is in the room. Do not answer the door. Notify Public Safety or police. Provide information as needed. Wait for the police to assist your exit from the building: Follow all instructions by police officers Police may not know if the shooter is hiding among you, therefore police may search you and your belongings for everyone's safety. If you are trapped with the shooter, you need to decide whether to: Stay still and play dead. Run for an exit, or Attack the shooter. Online safety Never give personal information to people that you don\u2019t know (name, home address, phone number, etc.). If you decide to talk to someone on the phone don\u2019t give out your number; call them and use caller ID block. Use a nickname in chat rooms or message boards. Meet chat friends in public places and with other friends; take a cell phone with you. Never go to someone\u2019s room, apartment or house that you just met. Holiday security If you leave campus during school holidays store your bicycle with Student Housing. If you leave your car on campus find out where you are supposed to park it and remove all valuables from it. Place valuables that you cannot take with you out of sight in your room/apartment/home and unplug all appliances before you leave. Park your car in a well-lit location and leave your keys and contact information with a trusted friend. If you stay on campus during holidays or the summer be alert to any suspicious persons around the residence halls, bike racks, or parking lots. Call Public Safety or the Police immediately to report any unusual activity. Studying or traveling abroad Gain as much information as possible about the county that you will be traveling to. Visit (Inoculation Requirements) Check your medical health insurance coverage. Make two extra copies of all your travel information (passport, airline tickets, etc.); leave one set at home with a relative or close friend and take a copy with you. Know your credit card limits. Make certain that a trusted family member is aware of the location of all your legal papers; legal will, insurance documents, mortgage information, internet/cell phone passwords, etc. Leave valuable or expensive looking jewelry at home. Do not bring large amounts of cash; use traveler\u2019s checks or credit cards. Take a list of all important telephone numbers (family, U.S. Embassy and Consulate, campus emergency numbers). When you arrive, secure a copy of your important information in a safe and secure location. Bring an extra pair of prescription glasses. Pack your medical prescriptions in their original containers. Mark all luggage on the inside and outside with your name, address and telephone number; if possible cover your outside luggage tags."

The initiative includes setting up rapid response units at each police station for emergency management. Officers will receive training in contemporary investigation methods and technological applications for crime prevention. Additional CCTV cameras will be positioned at key locations with regular monitoring of footage. Singh said that criminals released on bail will be under consistent surveillance.

This page, Crime Prevention and Safety Tips, is\noffered by show more Crime Prevention and Safety Tips Crime Prevention and Safety Tips Senior citizens continue to be the fastest-growing segment of our population, and that makes seniors a prime target for con artists and thieves. Crime prevention is everyone's responsibility, not just law enforcement. One of the best ways to take an active part in crime prevention is to become more alert and aware of what is going on around you. Crime can be reduced by following some simple measures like locking your doors, watching out for your neighbors, and keeping your personal information secure. Seniors are often targets as criminals focus on their vulnerabilities. It is important to remember you can avoid becoming the victim of an illegal scheme or scam by simply refusing to participate. Protecting Yourself and Your Home Seniors are living longer and more independently than ever before. We all need and want a feeling of security in the safety of our homes. Your home should be a safe haven. Most burglaries occur during daylight hours and many intruders gain access through open or poorly secured doors and windows. Here are some precautions you can take to keep you and your home safe. Install solid, easy-to-use locks on your doors and windows, including sliders and garage. Use deadbolt locks on all the doors. Don't hide extra keys under the doormats or in planters, etc.-leave an extra set with a neighbor or friend. Install a peephole and make sure you use it. Never open the door to strangers. If a stranger asks to use your phone, offer to make the call for them. Ask service technicians or care providers you don't know for ID before you open the door. Trim trees and shrubs to eliminate hiding places. Keep your home well lit at night, inside and out. Draw the curtains and blinds at night. Engrave your valuables (don't use your Social Security number) and list their serial numbers and description. Protecting Yourself in the Community As our population ages and the number of senior citizens continues to increase, seniors have more and more opportunities to participate in civic groups, health programs, travel activities and entertainment. Use these tips to increase your personal security in the community. Do your activities in pairs-have a companion for shopping, walking, etc. Carry a small purse or bag, not one with a strap that can easily be cut or grabbed. Carry your purse close to your body. Don't carry credit cards you don't need or large amounts of cash. Contact your bank about free direct deposit of your government check. Criminals are keenly aware of when government checks arrive. When taking public transportation sit near the driver or close to an exit. If possible, ask the driver to watch until you are safely in the house. Always keep the doors and window locked in your car. Don't leave your purse or packages on the seat beside you-put them on the floor or in your trunk. Travel well lit streets and plan your route-be aware of your surroundings. When returning to your car check the front and back seats before entering. Never pick up hitchhikers. Protecting Yourself Against Fraud and Scams Each year billions of dollars are lost to fraudulent activities. Telemarketing, health care, home equity and home improvement fraud and identity theft are just a few of the scams conducted over the phone, by mail, through the internet and door-to-door. Seniors are often targets as criminals focus on their vulnerabilities. Here are some guidelines to help ensure the safety of your assets. Never give out your Social Security, credit card or bank account numbers. Destroy personal information on documents before discarding them-use a shredder if possible Don't fall for things that sound too good to be true-money, vacations, sweepstakes prizes, health cures, or low risk/high yield investment schemes. Do not agree to any home improvement or sales contract until you verify the existence and reputation of the business. Be sure all contractors you hire are licensed, bonded and insured. Have a lawyer or someone you trust examine any document before you sign it. Don't give money to a charitable organization until you verify its legitimacy by contacting the . Legitimate organizations do not require immediate response and should provide information by mail. Never send cash in the mail, or allow anyone to pick up a check at your home.

This page, Crime Prevention and Safety Tips, is offered by show more Crime Prevention and Safety Tips Crime Prevention and Safety Tips Senior citizens continue to be the fastest-growing segment of our population, and that makes seniors a prime target for con artists and thieves. Crime prevention is everyone's responsibility, not just law enforcement. One of the best ways to take an active part in crime prevention is to become more alert and aware of what is going on around you. Crime can be reduced by following some simple measures like locking your doors, watching out for your neighbors, and keeping your personal information secure. Seniors are often targets as criminals focus on their vulnerabilities. It is important to remember you can avoid becoming the victim of an illegal scheme or scam by simply refusing to participate. Protecting Yourself and Your Home Seniors are living longer and more independently than ever before. We all need and want a feeling of security in the safety of our homes. Your home should be a safe haven. Most burglaries occur during daylight hours and many intruders gain access through open or poorly secured doors and windows. Here are some precautions you can take to keep you and your home safe. Install solid, easy-to-use locks on your doors and windows, including sliders and garage. Use deadbolt locks on all the doors. Don't hide extra keys under the doormats or in planters, etc.-leave an extra set with a neighbor or friend. Install a peephole and make sure you use it. Never open the door to strangers. If a stranger asks to use your phone, offer to make the call for them. Ask service technicians or care providers you don't know for ID before you open the door. Trim trees and shrubs to eliminate hiding places. Keep your home well lit at night, inside and out. Draw the curtains and blinds at night. Engrave your valuables (don't use your Social Security number) and list their serial numbers and description. Protecting Yourself in the Community As our population ages and the number of senior citizens continues to increase, seniors have more and more opportunities to participate in civic groups, health programs, travel activities and entertainment. Use these tips to increase your personal security in the community. Do your activities in pairs-have a companion for shopping, walking, etc. Carry a small purse or bag, not one with a strap that can easily be cut or grabbed. Carry your purse close to your body. Don't carry credit cards you don't need or large amounts of cash. Contact your bank about free direct deposit of your government check. Criminals are keenly aware of when government checks arrive. When taking public transportation sit near the driver or close to an exit. If possible, ask the driver to watch until you are safely in the house. Always keep the doors and window locked in your car. Don't leave your purse or packages on the seat beside you-put them on the floor or in your trunk. Travel well lit streets and plan your route-be aware of your surroundings. When returning to your car check the front and back seats before entering. Never pick up hitchhikers. Protecting Yourself Against Fraud and Scams Each year billions of dollars are lost to fraudulent activities. Telemarketing, health care, home equity and home improvement fraud and identity theft are just a few of the scams conducted over the phone, by mail, through the internet and door-to-door. Seniors are often targets as criminals focus on their vulnerabilities. Here are some guidelines to help ensure the safety of your assets. Never give out your Social Security, credit card or bank account numbers. Destroy personal information on documents before discarding them-use a shredder if possible Don't fall for things that sound too good to be true-money, vacations, sweepstakes prizes, health cures, or low risk/high yield investment schemes. Do not agree to any home improvement or sales contract until you verify the existence and reputation of the business. Be sure all contractors you hire are licensed, bonded and insured. Have a lawyer or someone you trust examine any document before you sign it. Don't give money to a charitable organization until you verify its legitimacy by contacting the . Legitimate organizations do not require immediate response and should provide information by mail. Never send cash in the mail, or allow anyone to pick up a check at your home.

        "markdown": "8 Safety Tips for Female Digital Nomads in India For adventurous women, India poses a wide range of experiences that span from trekking the frozen Zanskar River, pub-hopping the streets of , and going shoulder-to-shoulder on a night trek with trained guards at Periyar Tiger Reserve. There is a lot to explore in this diverse country, but there\u2019s one question women traveling around India will run into again and again\u2014is India a safe destination for female travelers? With a population of over 1.4 billion, traveling in India can be challenging for women when it comes to the matter of safety, but after six years of exploring this beautiful country, I believe safety is also a state of mind. With the right mindset, cautionary steps, and savvy tech skills, it is possible to plan a safe workation as a woman in India. Here are my essential safety tips for women traveling in India. Choose Assertiveness Over Politeness If you want to travel safely in India, understand when to say no, when to stand up for yourself, and when to walk away. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a chance that you may experience behaviors from men like crossing boundaries, staring, and groping. For example, I\u2019ve found that drivers often crowd and hassle me at train or bus stations to offer their services. Instead of bothering with answering them and trying to be polite, I simply say no and walk away. If you are in a place alone with a man and sense anything unusual, try to walk away to a space with more people around. Once when I was traveling on the train, a man who sat opposite my seat started staring at me. The train was approaching the last station and I was the only one in the compartment. Without hesitation, I got up and switched to the next section of the train where there were a few more people. On the other hand, spaces with too many people can also be dangerous as this is where you are most likely to be groped. It can happen anywhere from a dance floor to a crowded bus, so be aware of your surroundings always. If it does happen to you, make a lot of noise and call for help. In India, being publicly shamed is a huge embarrassment and people will speak up and defend you. Avoid Arriving at Night I have traveled to different parts of India using various modes of transportation. But one thing I religiously stick to while traveling through this country is never arriving at a new destination in the middle of the night. If you don't have any other choice, make sure someone meets you at the bus stop, train station, or airport. Most accommodations offer pick-up services, which is much safer than taking random taxis at night. Try to avoid wandering on foot at night. If you leave a restaurant or pub late at night, ask the front desk or reception to arrange a taxi or auto. If you are commuting within the city alone at night, call someone (or pretend to) and share the taxi number loud enough for the driver to hear. This will make the driver aware that they can't mess up with you. Take a Cab Use taxi apps like Uber and Ola to get around in major cities. Strongly disagree and stand your ground if the driver wants to pick up an unknown person along the way. There are also cab services with women drivers, like in cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Kolkata, and Indore, in Bangalore, and in Jaipur. Try taking sleeper-class compartments mainly used by women, families, and other travelers or women-only compartments during long-distance train journeys to avoid any unpleasant encounters. Set Clear Boundaries Setting boundaries is a balancing act of being friendly and protecting yourself when dealing with men. To make sure they are not misreading your signals, you can call them baiyya, which means brother, so that your diplomatic or social behavior is not misunderstood. Some men may try to ask you personal questions, but you should never reveal too much about yourself or your travel plans. Unless you know them well, never eat or drink anything someone offers you. Safeguard Your Data and Gadgets While traveling in India, always have your gadgets locked and password protected, whether it\u2019s your laptop, phone, or tablet. Never leave your devices unattended when you are working in a cafe. Either lock it and hand over your gadgets at the reception desk or ask them to keep an eye on them when taking a restroom break. Use a padlock to lock your hostel lockers and gadget bag when using busy metros and public transportation. Never connect your devices to public WiFi, as this makes your data easily accessible to hackers. When working in or cafes, ensure you don't leave your confidential data in public view or vacate your desk without locking your laptop. If the coworking space doesn\u2019t have separate login credentials for each individual, that hides your IP address. Dress Respectfully India is a diverse country with many different cultures and customs that vary from region to region, so you will need to research . In most areas, it is appropriate to wear casual jeans and tops, but it is better to evade shoulder-revealing, knee-revealing, and body-hugging clothes to avoid unwanted attention. If you are visiting religious places, especially temples, make sure to wear a traditional dress like a salwar or saree. Western wear is much more acceptable in destinations like Goa and certain parts of Bangalore, Mumbai, and other metropolitan cities. Save Emergency Numbers Make sure to have the emergency dials saved in your phone ready to dial if you get into any undesired situations. 100: Police 1091: Women Helpline (All India) 139: Security assistance in train. If you are not in a situation to dial, send a private message to the for instant response. Helpline 112 is an app integrated with an emergency response system to address emergencies. The app requires registration along with your phone number, state, and current location and asks what kind of help is needed. Always keep someone updated about your daily travel plans so they can act promptly in emergencies. Carry a Self-Defense Tool A self-defense safety tool will give you the courage to navigate any place without feeling vulnerable about your safety. If you are a female traveling through India, a self-defense tool like pepper spray or a taser is a must, just like your phone and travel documents. But remember, a safety tool works only if you can easily access it at the right time. So if you are traveling alone in a cab at night or walking down a lonely road in an unknown place, keep your safety tool within easy reach, whether you feel threatened or not. \u200d Discover the Nurall lifestyle Latest POSTS By By",

Do not just decide what you feel \u201cin the moment.\u201d Deciding beforehand will make you less vulnerable to persuasion and forced intercourse. Set sexual limits for yourself. Do not perform or let anyone perform any sexual act towards you that makes you feel uncomfortable that exceeds your limit. Never feel ashamed about setting limits. If the person you are interested in is someone worth dating, they will respect your limits. Communicate firmly and early to your partner what your expectations for sexual encounters are. This will make it easier for your partner to know and accept your decision. Don\u2019t be afraid to be forceful and firm if you feel uncomfortable. If you are uncomfortable or fearful in a situation then get out of there, listen to your instincts. Be aware that alcohol and drugs are often related to date rape. Be sure to always have a friend with you who you trust in situations where you are drinking or using drugs and watch out for each other. Staying Safe when Drugs and Alcohol are Involved: Always go out with a group or at least one other person you trust.\u00a0 This is in case you or your friends become drunk; at least there are others there to make you look and feel less vulnerable to potentially dangerous situations. Never consume an unknown substance because you never know the effects it can have on your body and your mental state of mind. If you consume something that you don\u2019t know the effects of, you may end up in an incoherent state and you may not have the ability to think about your own safety. Don\u2019t accept alcohol (or drugs for that matter) from people you don\u2019t know and trust. You might think you know what is in it and what it will do to you, but it only takes a moment for someone to add an additional drug or other substance to that drink to make you much more intoxicated and vulnerable then that drink should have made you. Never get into a car where the driver has been drinking or doing drugs. Always look out for intoxicated friends.\u00a0 If friends of yours or people you know become intoxicated, keep an eye out for them in order to prevent them from being in a compromising situation. Never leave with someone that you don\u2019t know that well.\u00a0 Although you don\u2019t want to travel alone at night, you don\u2019t want to get a ride or leave with someone you can\u2019t completely trust either.

Don\u2019t wait until you leave on vacation to safeguard your home against intruders. Take these simple preventative steps to protect your home from the inside and outside while you\u2019re away. 1. Look for vulnerable spots. Walk around your home\u2019s exterior with an eye out for windows that could be easily pried open or with a clear view of your flat-screen TV and other valuables. Better yet, contact your local police department to see if they offer a home security check. They\u2019ll scour your home, inside and outside, and alert you to weak points. 2. Lock doors and windows. Shore up one of the main entry points of home break-ins\u2014your first-floor windows\u2014by installing a wireless alarm kit. For as little as $25, you\u2019ll get an alarm that sounds when a window is opened and more peace of mind. 3. Landscape strategically. Think thorny rose bushes under easy-to-access windows. And trim your shrubs so thieves can\u2019t hide behind them. Gravel walkways and driveways also work well to signal the presence of an unwanted visitor. 4. Put up a fence. Chain-link or ornamental metal fences secured by concrete pillars work best to keep intruders out. Solid fences with pointed tops are another good option. 5. Install double-key deadbolts. Believe it or not, many intruders\u00a0simply let themselves in through a home\u2019s front door. Consider getting double-key deadbolts which require two keys, one to enter and one to exit, so they\u2019re more secure. 6. Upgrade doors and locks. Thick wood doors are hard to kick in and can thwart a break-in. For doors with windows that can be broken, install a floor lock to keep a burglar from reaching in and unlocking the door. 7. Install motion sensor lighting. Motion detectors are excellent deterrents. Position them at entrances and dark spots around your home\u2019s perimeter. Live in an apartment with a dark parking lot or hallway? Ask your landlord to update the lighting in common areas. 8. Invest in a home security system. Installing a home alarm system is one of the most foolproof ways to prevent burglary. Or you can go one step further and install security cameras, preferably with night vision and a hard drive to store video recordings. 9. Secure sliders. Sliding glass doors tend to be easy to unlock and slide open. The solution? Stick a broom handle in the track to keep it secure. 10. Hope for the best, and prepare for the worst. Play it safe in case your computer is stolen by backing it up. Then, stash your hard drive somewhere unexpected, like a kitchen cabinet or linen closet. Ditto for any cash in the house. Snap pictures of valuables and record model numbers and purchase prices in case you need to file a claim. 11. Get a safe. Precious jewels, passports, and other essential documents belong in a fireproof safe, preferably built into a wall or bolted to the floor. 12. Change the locks. Whether you\u2019re a homeowner or a renter, changing the locks is a good practice. You have no way of knowing how many keys were issued or copies made for the old locks. 13. Reinforce windows. Small windows are easy targets for burglars, especially at the basement level. To make them less vulnerable, install safety glass or metal bars. 14. Don\u2019t advertise. Going out of town for an extended period? Don\u2019t tell the world on social media or even leave a message on your outgoing voicemail. Both moves make you easy prey for computer-savvy burglars. 15. Have a neighbor check-in. Even better, pay them to house-sit. They can use your trash cans, take in your mail, newspapers, and packages, and leave tire tracks in your driveway and footprints on your front walkway. Any signs of life help avert a break-in. Note: Don\u2019t leave your spare key under a mat. Give it to your neighbor or stow it in a combination lockbox in a discreet place. 16. Put timers on lights. Use timers that automatically turn on lamps in select rooms after dark. Set outdoor lights to turn on in the evening. 17. Lock your garage door. And if you have one, disconnect the automatic door opener. Garage doors are an easy access point if they remain unlocked while you\u2019re away, even for a few days. 18. Leave a radio on. It\u2019s an easy and inexpensive way to create the illusion that someone is at home. If the unthinkable happens and your home is broken into, avoid the impulse to go inside in case the burglar is still there. Call the police immediately from your cell phone or a neighbor\u2019s house. And remember not to touch anything. Fingerprints help solve crimes.
