Many falls can be prevented by addressing your fall risk factors. Assessment and Treatment of Health and Physical Conditions A thorough evaluation can find out your risks. Treatment can lower them. For example, Managing heart problems can improve your function and reduce risk of fainting Keeping nerves, joints and feet healthy and less painful helps with balance. Getting new glasses or hearing aids may help you see and hear around you better. Treating eye problems, like cataracts, glaucoma, or macular degenerationcan help prevent falls. People with long-lasting illnesses, like dementia, depression, anxiety, or arthritis need treatment to reduce fall risks. People with osteoporosis or osteopenia (bone loss) need enough vitamin D and calcium to avoid further bone loss, or medications to help strengthen bones. Exercise Exercise can improve a person\u2019s balance and strength. This helps to prevent falls. Your healthcare professional may recommend working with a physical therapist or participating in a special exercise program. Research shows that the following three types of activities are effective for older people at risk of falling: Balance and coordination exercises Resistance and weight training to increase strength Cardiovascular, endurance, and fitness training A combination of these three types of activities is the most effective at reducing fall risk. Some exercise combines these types of activities. Balance and coordination exercise, such as Tai Chi, has been studied and offers the most benefit in reducing fall risk. All exercise programs need to progress. As a person becomes more secure and strong, the exercises need to change so a person remains challenged and continue to improve. Use of Assistive Devices and Other Aids Sometimes a person needs aids to help them with walking, balance, completing daily activities (bathing and dressing) or reaching for things. A physical or occupational therapist can figure out what is best for someone\u2019s needs and provide training in the use of all types of aids. Among the most common aids are: Canes and walkers Reachers (to pick up items without bending over) Shower benches and raised toilet seats in the bathroom Medication Changes Some types of medications can increase the risks of falls and fractures.A healthcare professional needs to review all of a person\u2019s medicines and reduce them as much as possible. You are at an increased risk of a fall if: You take four or more prescription medications You have recently changed the number of medications you take You have recently changed the dosage Never stop taking medications, or reduce your dose, unless you have discussed with your healthcare provider. Environment Hazards An occupational therapist or other qualified person can evaluate your home\u2019s safety or you can use a simple home safety checklist. Improvements that can help reduce fall risk include: Using good lighting, such as night lights and lamps in dim areas Removing loose carpeting and other floor clutter to decrease tripping Assessing furniture such as bed height, low or soft chairs and chairs with wheels Adding grab bars,and non-slip bathmats in bathrooms Adding railings on stairs and in corridors. Using good fitting footwear in and out of the home, that has a back and a sole. Education and Goals Education is a key part of any fall prevention plan. Knowing the causes and your own specific risk factors can help prevent a fall. Talking to your healthcare team about your health goals and what matters to you is also important to a fall prevention plan. You can find additional resources on the CDC's .

In the bathroom, Keep electrical appliances wrapped and away from water. Use non-slip strips or floor mats Always keep the room clean and as dry as possible. In the bedroom, Never smoke. As always, ensure that everything else is a safe distance away from a source of fire or heat. Opt for mattresses with open flame-resistant\u00a0protection. You\u2019re most vulnerable when you sleep. Even in bed, keep a phone, light, (and, if necessary,\na weapon) within reach. In the garage, This is probably where you store most of your tools and equipment. Take precautions with flammable\nliquids, chemicals, and anything producing fumes. Keep poisonous substances (paint thinner, antifreeze, rat poison, etc.) locked up and out of\nreach of children and pets. Keep your space clean and organized,\u00a0especially as many of your tools are sharp,\nheavy, or otherwise dangerous. In the yard, Surround your property with a sturdy fence\u00a0(this is more for keeping in children and\npets, but can also serve to remind strangers to keep out). If you\u2019ve got a pool,\u00a0keep it locked down or fenced in when not in use. Be careful when working in bad weather.\u00a0Use sand, salt, and good-traction footware\non ice and snow. On the stairs, Keep steps clean and dry. Always install stable and sturdy railing\u00a0on both sides of the stairs. Ensure that the distance between the rails is narrow enough to prevent a child or infant\n      from falling through. Good rule of thumb: less than four inches! Keep stairs well lit. Guard against fire with these home safety tips: Install smoke detectors,\u00a0check them regularly, and replace the batteries at least\nonce a year. Avoid overloading\u00a0outlets and extension cords. Keep fire extinguishers\u00a0handy and know how to use them. Establish a safety exit,\u00a0ensure all family members know and understand it, practice\nwith drills, and ensure it\u2019s never blocked. Never block or pile things on heaters or near heat-exuding appliances;\u00a0give these a\nwide berth, plenty of breathing room, and make sure they don\u2019t get overheated. Ensure that all materials are fire-resistant\u00a0if you\u2019re renovating or just fixing up\nsomething around the house. Never leave any type of fire or hot appliance unattended. Remove dry vegetation\u00a0around your home, especially during the dry seasons. Cover the fireplace\u00a0with a stable and large metal fire frame. Have easy access to important phone numbers: the police, the fire department, poison control, and trusted family, friends, and neighbors, in case of an emergency. Clearly mark your street number on the mailbox, fence, gate, or wall so you can easily be located in case of an emergency. Consider investing on a if you're working in the home care industry. 85% of all U.S. fire deaths in 2009 occurred in homes (4) Every 14.6 seconds, one burglary takes place.(5) Most Burglars Leave Immediately When Forced Entry Fails Typically, burglars spend less than 60 seconds breaking into a home. The more difficult it is to gain access, the more likely a burglar is to reconsider the attack. (6) Establish an evacuation plan and discuss it with the rest of the household. Purchase, renew, and check all of your home\u2019s smoke alarms. Buy a fire extinguisher and have it in a handy, easily accessible location. Place a \u201csave the baby\u201d or \u201csave our pet\u201d sticker on a front window to alert firefighters\nabout family members who can\u2019t save themselves. Keep the indoors a no-smoking zone; put up signs and stickers if need be. Never leave fire\u2014used in whichever room and for whatever purpose\u2014unattended. Guarding Against Intruders Install a home security system. Make sure locks\u00a0are in place and are functioning correctly. Always check through a peephole or window before opening the door when somebody knocks. Keep your doors closed even when you\u2019re home,\u00a0including the garage doors. Keep blinds or curtains closed so you don\u2019t advertise what\u2019s inside (especially in expensive rooms!). Store your valuables in a safe or a very clever hiding spot, instead of leaving them lying around. Protect sliding doors from intrusion by inserting a metal bar or pipe on the bottom track (make sure it\u2019s the same length). Request identification if a stranger claims to be a police officer or other government official. Adopt a guard dog. Report any suspicious activity around your house or in the neighbourhood to the local authorities immediately. Don\u2019t leave digital footprints for criminals. Social networks provide an easy, fun, and dangerous way to announce your exact whereabouts and all times. We often forget that our friends aren\u2019t the only ones privy all of to the information that we post. Never announce that you\u2019re leaving your home, especially for prolonged absences. Never post your address or phone number. Be careful of the information you provide on your answering machine, voicemail, or email\nsignatures. Households with Children Never leave children alone or unattended near water or fire. If a child is missing, always check bodies of water (pool or bathtub) first\u2014you can prevent a\ndrowning by mere seconds. Unload and lock away firearms, and any other weapons. Keep medications and chemicals\u00a0safely out of reach. Keep choking hazards (small items and small food) safely out of reach. Keep heavy or breakable objects safely out of reach. Use round-ended furniture, and avoid sharp objects and accessories. Secure household items; prevent tipping by securing bookcases, shelves, and other objects or appliances that could disastrously fall. Immediately replace any damaged, frayed, or faulty materials\u00a0or appliances that could pose a hazard to an unsuspecting child. Cover outlets, ground appliances, and coil extension cords when not in use; although these are rules to be followed anyway, they are especially important with children underfoot. Avoid lead poisoning by double-checking the toys and equipment for your child. Opt only for cribs, high chairs, and other regularly used furniture that have been painted after\n1978. Buy new furniture; old pieces might be worn down or have missing parts, which is hazardous. The UL logo indicates products that have been expertly inspected, verified, and deemed safe. Reduce the risk of suffocation. Remove access to trunks, old refrigerators, car trunks, and any other such area where children could\nget locked in. Keep beds and cribs as bare as possible\u2014infants in particular are susceptible to suffocation. Block or lock the windows, stairways, and doors to prevent accidental falls or unintended wanderings by small children. Protect kids from plants. Plants are beautiful, infuse the air with oxygen, and decorate a room nicely. But they can be toxic if consumed. Know what plants you have, and opt for the safest ones. Households with Elders Guard against falls: Install rails along the staircase, in the bathroom. Secure windows, block stairways, and lock doors. Replace unstable or slippery rugs and runners. Ensure the floor is always clean, clear, and dry. General tips: Keep rooms well lit;\u00a0elders often have trouble with vision (or other senses, in which\ncase it\u2019s even more important for them to see). Use night lights or motion-sensor lights\u00a0for easy navigation. Arrange furniture for easy navigation. Rearrange\u00a0furniture and items to make often-used objects more accessible. Easy access to phone numbers\u00a0in case of an emergency or in order to contact family/a\ntrusted neighbor. When Vacationing Away From Home Lock up. Ensure that all your locks are functioning properly and that all doors and windows are locked. Create the illusion that someone is home: Turn on (and leave on) a TV or stereo Leave some interior lights on; use a timer if you\u2019re gone for more than a day. Leave on exterior lighting Use exterior lights that turn on via motion detectors Never leave notes on the door when you go out (for a neighbor, handyman, family member, or whomever)\u2014this is practically you hollering that you\u2019ve left the building. Lower your ring tone. If you\u2019ll be gone for a while, adjust your telephone so that the volume is low, and the incessant ringing doesn\u2019t trumpet your absence. Pull the plug on certain appliances. You don\u2019t need the toaster, the computer, or the washing machine to be on, for example. You\u2019ll save energy, money, and the risk of something messing up or igniting due to power surges or other mishaps. Have a trusted neighbour or friend regularly pick up your mail. Never pause or cancel mail delivery\u2014you never know who might pick up on that. Never leave extra keys in expected places. Under the doormat and in the flowerpot next to the door aren\u2019t the wisest of hiding places. Find a very inconspicuous place, or entrust a good neighbour. ----Home Safety Tips: Sources ---- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)",

Allow for air circulation around the appliances, especially for those which generate heat (clocks, computer monitors, etc.). If overheated, give appliances space and turned-off time to cool off. Always follow instructions; enlist the help of professionals and leave the amateur repairs for less dangerous materials. Never poke things into toasters, outlets, or any other electrical appliances with tempting openings. Touch appliances with dry hands only. Ensure that exhaust fans are clean,\u00a0and remove the lint regularly. Always turn off power before you plug or unplug the appliances. In the kitchen, Keep range hood filters as clean as possible. Prevent the hazardous build-up of burnt food and spilled fats by habitually cleaning hot plates\nand ovens. Clean the oven and toaster regularly to avoid a dangerous build-up of crumbs, germs, and\nrubbish. Remove fumes by using a ventilation system or exhaust fan. Never leave a turned-on electrical appliance unattended, especially when cooking! In the bathroom, Don\u2019t use extension or power leads in wet areas. Refrain from touching anything electrical when you\u2019ve got wet hands or bare feet. Switch off and unplug appliances that aren\u2019t in use (hairdryers, styling irons, electric razors,\netc.). In the event that an electrical appliance is immersed in water, discard it at once. Never reach to pull it out of the water\u2014even if it\u2019s off. Turn off the power source at the circuit breaker box, then unplug the appliance. For your own sake, always replace the appliance. Non-fatal Shocks are Suprisingly Common 30,000+ non-fatal shock accidents occur each year. (5) Many Parents Don't Protect Outlets 7 children are treated in hospital emergency rooms every single day for electrical shock or burn injuries caused by tampering with a wall outlet. (5) Every Day Products Can Be Deadly 60 people die every year by electrocutions from consumer products. The three leading killers are small appliances (i.e toaster ovens), power tools, and lighting equipment.(5) Most Electrical Accidents Occur Under Adult Supervision 70% of child related electrical accidents occur at home when adult supervision is present. (5) Turn off electrical appliances when not in use. Never overload sockets, outlets, or cords. Replace frayed, splinted, or otherwise damaged cords. Use electrical appliances and tools only in dry locations and situations. Take your electrically-charged environment into account when outdoors. In case of an electric fire, fight back with a fire extinguisher or baking soda. Be familiar with your switchboard; where it is, how it operates, and label the switches. Keep Caution with the Cords Regularly check cords for cranks, kinks, splints, or frays before each use. In a commercial area,\u00a0employees who are exposed to electricity must have a proper to minimize or to avoid potential electrical accidents. Ensure cords are firmly plugged; if the cord\u2019s too loose (or the holes are too snug), choose another outlet with a better fit. Use cords only for their particular purpose. Electrical appliance cords aren\u2019t clothes lines, leashes, or jump ropes. Never staple or nail a cord in place. If you need to secure a cord more securely, tape it in place or apply twist-ties as needed. Never modify the cord. Leave the prongs alone and never attempt to file down a wide prong in order to fit it somewhere else. Use extension cords sparingly. These are supposed to be temporary solutions. Make sure you\u2019re using the right cord; use the correct length, proper weight, and type (indoor or outdoor). Pull on the cord at the outlet when unplugging\u2014never on the cord itself. Don\u2019t let electric wires or cables meander under carpets (at best, it\u2019s a tripping hazard) or above other appliances (something might blow up). The Hazards of Outlets Block unused outlets with a solid cover plate or childproof caps. Few electrical safety tips are more important when you have young children in the house. Encase all outlets properly with solid, secure plates so that all the wiring is enclosed. Relocate cords instead of overloading outlets. Not only is it a mess, but it could be very dangerous. Never place anything into the outlet except for the appropriately-sized plug.\u00a0That includes metal objects and liquids! Use ground fault circuit interrupter outlets in case of potentially dangerous situations (pools, bathrooms, kitchens, unfinished rooms). The Everyday Light Bulb: Tips and Tweaks Use bulbs with the correct wattage. Higher wattage bulbs may cause overheating. Always screw bulbs tightly; beware loose bulbs, which could cause shorts and sparks. Always unplug or switch off the fixture before replacing a bulb. Switch to compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL); these provide the same level of light at a lower wattage level, which is safer and better for the environment and your pocket. If a CFL bulb breaks, open the windows and evacuate the room for 15 minutes. Electrical Safety Outside the House Maintain a distance from power lines. You don\u2019t want your house to be close to them, and keep trees pruned and far away from the power\nlines as well. Never fly kites, balloons, or model airplanes near power lines; also, climb trees somewhere else. Never situate or climb on a ladder that could fall on or very close to a power line. Be on the lookout for power lines when using a chainsaw or other outdoor equipment. Never swim (and try not to use water) during an electrical storm if you spot lightening. Always assume that contact with a power line is lethal. If a power line is down, do not touch it to see if it\u2019s live. Contact your local authorities\nimmediately. Check the weather channel: powerful winds can make power lines sway, storms can bring them down, and\neven extreme heat can cause them to sag. Never climb the fence that surrounds an electrical substation. If your pet or baseball finds its way inside, call the electric company to retrieve it for you. Keep electrical appliances and tools dry\u2014 out of the rain, off of wet surfaces, and away from pools, ponds, fountains, etc. Only allow outdoor outlets on a circuit guarded by a GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter). The Danger of Electrical Fires Avoid overloading plugs, sockets, and extension cords. Replace tools that give off any mild electric shocks. Replace light switches that are flickering. Replace light switches with hot faceplates. Warm is okay\u2014hot is bad. Replace all damaged cords. Never attempt to push a three-prong plug into a two-holed socket. Never attempt electrical repairs if you don\u2019t have the expertise and certification. Never fight an electrical fire with water\u2014 instead, reach for the fire extinguisher or baking soda. Water conducts electricity, so the fire could actually ignite further. If you have any doubt about fighting the fire, it\u2019s time to flee. If you decide that you have a reasonable chance, fight the fire but make sure that you\u2019re near the exit and no obstacles can stop you. Learn how to use a fire extinguisher effectively: pull, aim, squeeze, and sweep. Watch for tripping breakers: it\u2019s a very important warning if you\u2019re circuit breaker is immediately tripping after you\u2019ve reset it. It\u2019s forewarning you that there\u2019s an electrical hazard in the house. Turn off electrical appliances when they\u2019re not in use; always attend to them when they\u2019re on. Keep all flammable objects a few feet away from heaters and any appliances that tend to heat up quickly (computers, televisions, etc.). ---- Electrical Safety Tips: Sources ---- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)",

Always keep your stove company. Especially if you\u2019re frying something\u2014that\u2019s when things can cross the line in mere seconds. It's one of the simplest fire safety tips, but it's also the leading cause of kitchen fires. Keep it clean. Keep stove and counter surfaces free of clutter, grease, and especially flammable objects like hairspray, bug spray, or air freshener. In case of an emergency you\u2019ll be able to react faster given the freedom of space. Set a timer. Don't just rely on your brain; we're human, and we get distracted. A timer can remind you to switch off the burner or oven, saving your food and possibly your house from being burnt. In case of a pan fire, control the fire by: Covering the pan with a lid or a bigger upturned pan. Turn the heat off. Spray the pot with a fire extinguisher.\u00a0If you're an employer, consider a for your employees to be able to know the proper use of the\ndevice. If you don't have a fire extinguisher handy, douse the burning oil with baking soda. Never run with a pan fire. You run the risk of spreading the fire further when the oil\ndrips. Never throw water on the pan\u2014it will splatter the oil and spread the fire, possibly\nburning you. Never throw sugar or flour on a grease fire. Flour might look like baking soda, but it's\nnot, so it won't react similarly! One cup of either of these baking products contains the\nexplosive potential of two sticks of dynamite. (Pay special attention this fire safety tip, it\ncan result in third degree burns and even death in some cases.) Wear tight clothes. Billowing sleeves or hanging accessories above a lit stove can spell disaster. Install a smoke detector in the kitchen. In a commercial enviroment, consider investing in for employees. In The Laundry Room The proper dryer duct should vent directly outdoors\u2014never to a room inside the house, as the air discharge can contain a combination of combustible gases. Avoid plastic duct work, which is more easily ignited or melted; opt for a hard metal duct (with as few bends as possible) from the dryer to the exterior of your home. You'll breathe more easily when you load your laundry. Keep the duct free of lint to help reduce the chance of fire spreading from the dryer to the vent. Clean the lint trap after every use. A professional should also help you periodically dismantle the dryer to clean between the dryer drum and the heat element. Install a smoke detector nearby. By Hearth and Candlelight Never leave fire unattended. Candles may be small, and the flames they produce may be even smaller, but it takes just a few breaths for an upturned candle to create an inferno. Use a smart surface. Always place candles on a non-flammable surface, and keep them away from paper, curtains, and other items that could be easily ignited. Use a screen in front of the hearth\u2014make sure it's large and heavy enough to encompass the entire opening and to stop any stray logs from rolling out of the fireplace. Perform regular check-ups. Chimneys and woodstoves require annual (and thorough!) cleaning, and monthly inspection in case of obstructions or damage. Never burn paper, trash, or green wood; apart from being highly flammable, scraps of burning paper or trash may actually drift up through the chimney or pipe and land on\u2014and light up\u2014your roof. Extinguish the fire once you want to move away from it and cool the ashes. Ensure that the ashes are then harmlessly sealed away in a metal container outside the home. Fires Kill 50% More Men Than Women This is largely due to the fact that men are more likely to work in industrial jobs that involve dangerous usage of fire. (4) Adults Aged 70+ Are At Extremely High Risk Seniors over 70 account for 1/3rd of all fire born deaths even though they account for just 9% of the U.S population. This means that seniors are nearly 4x more likely to die in a fire than the rest of the population.(2) The U.S Leads The Industrialized World in Fire Deaths The U.S death rate from fire is 30% to 50% higher than other industrialized nations, and triple the death rate of Switzerland and The Netherlands.(3) Establish an evacuation plan and discuss it with the rest of the household. Purchase, renew, and check all of your home\u2019s smoke alarms. Buy a fire extinguisher and have it in a handy, easily accessible location. Place a \u201csave the baby\u201d or \u201csave our pet\u201d sticker on a front window to alert firefighters\nabout family members who can\u2019t save themselves. Keep the indoors a no-smoking zone; put up signs and stickers if need be. Never leave fire\u2014used in whichever room and for whatever purpose\u2014unattended. Hazardous ELECTRICS & APPLIANCES Be a smart shopper. Buy electrical products evaluated by the nationally recognized laboratory (i.e. UL). Be sure to check the label as products often contain their own set of fire safety tips and warnings. Replace all frayed wires: worn, old, or damaged appliance cords belong in the dumpster and not shoved under the rug. Use three-prong plugs in three-slot outlets, and two-slot plug into two-slot outlets. Make sure your kids know this, too. Portable space heaters heaters must be kept four feet or more away from combustible surfaces and objects. Ensure that your heater has a thermostat control mechanism (so it automatically switches off if it\nfalls over!). Never overheat it, and always use it in a well-ventilated room. If it's a kerosene heater, clear K-1 kerosene should be the only thing you're feeding it. Smoke Alarms: A Necessity, Not an Option Invest in a few smoke detectors if you haven't already. As the only household item that's on the alert 24/7 against the threat of a fire, smoke detectors save lives every day\u2014and they could save yours. Install dual sensor smoke alarms; make sure they contain both ionization and photoelectric smoke sensors. Spread them out on every story of your home, and definitely install them in the kitchen, laundry room, and every bedroom. Test your smoke detectors once a month. Replace the batteries at least once a year (possible exception: non-replaceable 10-year lithium batteries; still, be sure to test them); many manufacturers also encourage a replacement of the smoke detectors after a decade. Never disable a smoke alarm, including when you're cooking. Open a window, wave a dishtowel to clear the air, and let it blast its warning that you might have just overcooked your meal. Smoke alarms for the disabled. Audible alarms are available for the visually impaired (the sound of the alarm shouldn't be a\nmonotone; a small pause of silence helps this person hear voices or other critical sounds in the\nsurrounding environment). Visual alarms (with a flashing light or vibrating pad) are available for the hearing impaired. For more vulnerable residents, there are also smoke alarms with outdoor strobe lights (to alert the\nneighbors) and emergency systems for summoning help. Install an automatic fire sprinkler indoors. Smokers Pose an Additional Danger Keep the indoors a no-smoking zone. If you must smoke, smoke outdoors; too many home fires begin inside the home, with smoking materials as the catalyst. Be alert. Don't snooze and smoke. If you're feeling the slightest bit drowsy (due to sleep deprivation, medication, alcohol, or any other reason), put out your fire immediately. Snuff them out. Extinguish the cigarette in a sand-filled can, or drown cigarette butts and ashes in water. Never throw away hot cigarette butts or ashes without attending to them properly. Never smoke where oxygen is being used; for instance, a family member might be using home oxygen therapy, but even if the oxygen is turned off, the building is much more vulnerable. Oxygen can be explosive and will only serve to fan the flames. Establishing an Evacuation Plan: Fire Exits in the Home Draw up an escape plan. This is a critical proactive step; it's easier to follow up on something we've visualized and practiced before, particularly when we need to repeat it during a chaotic emergency. Plan at least two escape routes;\u00a0from every room\u2014particularly the bedrooms, where you're\nmost likely to be caught unaware, relaxed, and/or asleep. Purchase fire ladders;\u00a0for the upper stories: ensure that these ladders are collapsible\nand have been evaluated by a nationally recognized laboratory (i.e. UL). Check windows;\u00a0to make sure that the glass isn't stuck and that screens can be swiftly\nremoved. Discuss the escape routes with your family; every single member of the household should know the basic safety procedures: Stop, Drop, and Roll; bring home those school fire-drill mantras. Practice; can you feel your way out of the house with your eyes closed, or in the dark? Do you know the quickest way to crawl out? Do you know the low windows from which you could jump? Do you instinctively use the back of your hand to feel a door's heat, and do you remain crouched down as close to the floor as possible? ---- Fire Safety Tips Sources ---- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)",

(Pay special attention this fire safety tip, it\n                        can result in third degree burns and even death in some cases.) Wear\n                            tight clothes. Billowing sleeves or hanging accessories above a lit stove can spell\n                        disaster. Install\n                            a smoke detector in the kitchen. In a commercial enviroment, consider investing in for employees. In The Laundry Room The proper dryer duct should vent directly outdoors\u2014never to a\n                        room inside the house, as the air discharge can contain a combination of combustible gases. Avoid\n                            plastic duct work, which is more easily ignited or melted; opt for a hard metal\n                        duct (with as few bends as possible) from the dryer to the exterior of your home. You'll breathe\n                        more easily when you load your laundry. Keep\n                            the duct free of lint to help reduce the chance of fire spreading from the dryer\n                        to the vent. Clean the lint trap after every use. A professional should also help you\n                        periodically dismantle the dryer to clean between the dryer drum and the heat element. Install\n                            a smoke detector nearby. By Hearth and Candlelight Never leave fire\n                            unattended. Candles may be small, and the flames they produce may be even smaller,\n                        but it takes just a few breaths for an upturned candle to create an inferno. Use a\n                            smart surface. Always place candles on a non-flammable surface, and keep them away\n                        from paper, curtains, and other items that could be easily ignited. Use a\n                            screen in front of the hearth\u2014make sure it's large and heavy enough to encompass\n                        the entire opening and to stop any stray logs from rolling out of the fireplace. Perform\n                            regular check-ups. Chimneys and woodstoves require annual (and thorough!)\n                        cleaning, and monthly inspection in case of obstructions or damage. Never\n                            burn paper, trash, or green wood; apart from being highly flammable, scraps of\n                        burning paper or trash may actually drift up through the chimney or pipe and land on\u2014and light\n                        up\u2014your roof. Extinguish\n                            the fire once you want to move away from it and cool the ashes. Ensure that the\n                        ashes are then harmlessly sealed away in a metal container outside the home. Fires\n                            Kill 50% More Men Than Women This is largely due to the fact that men are more\n                            likely to work in industrial jobs that involve dangerous usage of fire. (4) Adults Aged 70+ Are At Extremely High Risk Seniors over 70 account for 1/3rd of\n                            all fire born deaths even though they account for just 9% of the U.S population. This means\n                            that seniors are nearly 4x more likely to die in a fire than the rest of the\n                            population. (2) The U.S Leads The\n                            Industrialized World in Fire Deaths The U.S death rate from fire is 30% to 50%\n                            higher than other industrialized nations, and triple the death rate of Switzerland and The\n                            Netherlands. (3) Establish an evacuation plan and discuss it with the rest of the household. Purchase, renew, and check all of your home\u2019s smoke alarms. Buy a fire extinguisher and have it in a handy, easily accessible location. Place a \u201csave the baby\u201d or \u201csave our pet\u201d sticker on a front window to alert firefighters\n                            about family members who can\u2019t save themselves. Keep the indoors a no-smoking zone; put up signs and stickers if need be. Never leave fire\u2014used in whichever room and for whatever purpose\u2014unattended. Hazardous ELECTRICS & APPLIANCES Be a smart shopper. Buy electrical products evaluated by the\n                    nationally recognized laboratory (i.e. UL). Be sure to check\n                        the label as products often contain their own set of fire safety tips and warnings. Replace all\n                        frayed wires: worn, old, or damaged appliance cords belong in the dumpster and not\n                    shoved under the rug. Use\n                        three-prong plugs in three-slot outlets, and two-slot plug into two-slot outlets. Make\n                    sure your kids know this, too. Portable\n                        space heaters heaters must be kept four feet or more away from combustible surfaces and\n                    objects. Ensure that your heater has a thermostat control mechanism (so it automatically switches off if it\n                    falls over!). Never overheat it, and always use it in a well-ventilated room. If it's a kerosene heater, clear K-1 kerosene should be the only thing you're feeding it. Smoke Alarms: A Necessity, Not an Option Invest in a few smoke detectors if you haven't already. As the only\n                    household item that's on the alert 24/7 against the threat of a fire, smoke detectors save lives\n                    every day\u2014and they could save yours. Install\n                        dual sensor smoke alarms; make sure they contain both ionization and photoelectric\n                    smoke sensors. Spread them\n                        out on every story of your home, and definitely install them in the kitchen, laundry\n                    room, and every bedroom. Test your smoke detectors once a month. Replace the\n                    batteries at least once a year (possible exception: non-replaceable 10-year lithium batteries;\n                    still, be sure to test them); many manufacturers also encourage a replacement of the smoke detectors\n                    after a decade. Never\n                        disable a smoke alarm, including when you're cooking. Open a window, wave a dishtowel\n                    to clear the air, and let it blast its warning that you might have just overcooked your meal. Smoke\n                        alarms for the disabled. Audible alarms are available for the visually impaired (the sound of the alarm shouldn't be a\n                    monotone; a small pause of silence helps this person hear voices or other critical sounds in the\n                    surrounding environment). Visual alarms (with a flashing light or vibrating pad) are available for the hearing impaired. For more vulnerable residents, there are also smoke alarms with outdoor strobe lights (to alert the\n                    neighbors) and emergency systems for summoning help. Install an\n                        automatic fire sprinkler indoors. Smokers Pose an Additional Danger Keep the indoors a no-smoking zone. If you must smoke, smoke outdoors;\n                    too many home fires begin inside the home, with smoking materials as the catalyst. Be alert. Don't\n                    snooze and smoke. If you're feeling the slightest bit drowsy (due to sleep deprivation, medication,\n                    alcohol, or any other reason), put out your fire immediately. Snuff them\n                        out. Extinguish the cigarette in a sand-filled can, or drown cigarette butts and ashes\n                    in water. Never throw\n                        away hot cigarette butts or ashes without attending to them properly. Never smoke\n                        where oxygen is being used; for instance, a family member might be using home oxygen\n                    therapy, but even if the oxygen is turned off, the building is much more vulnerable. Oxygen can be\n                    explosive and will only serve to fan the flames. Establishing an Evacuation Plan: Fire Exits in the\n                        Home Draw up an escape plan. This is a critical proactive step; it's easier\n                    to follow up on something we've visualized and practiced before, particularly when we need to repeat\n                    it during a chaotic emergency. Plan at least two escape routes;\u00a0from every room\u2014particularly the bedrooms, where you're\n                    most likely to be caught unaware, relaxed, and/or asleep. Purchase fire ladders;\u00a0for the upper stories: ensure that these ladders are collapsible\n                    and have been evaluated by a nationally recognized laboratory (i.e. UL). Check windows;\u00a0to make sure that the glass isn't stuck and that screens can be swiftly\n                    removed. Discuss the\n                        escape routes with your family; every single member of the household should know the\n                    basic safety procedures: Stop, Drop, and Roll; bring home those school fire-drill mantras. Practice; can\n                    you feel your way out of the house with your eyes closed, or in the dark? Do you know the quickest\n                    way to crawl out? Do you know the low windows from which you could jump? Do you instinctively use\n                    the back of your hand to feel a door's heat, and do you remain crouched down as close to the floor\n                    as possible? ---- Fire Safety Tips Sources ---- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)"

Only use three-prong plugs in three-slot outlets (and, similarly: two-slot plug into two-slot outlets). Equipment that emanates substantial heat should be at least several feet away from combustible surfaces and objects. Heaters must include a thermostat control mechanism. Fires Causes Around $10 Billion In Damage Per Year Direct property loss due to fires in the U.S. was an estimated $10.6 billion in 2001.(2) 100 Firefighters Die Each Year About 100 firefighters are killed each year in duty-related incidents.(6) Know and follow an established emergency and evacuation plan.

OSHA says that a permit-required confined space: May contain a hazardous or potentially hazardous atmosphere. May contain a material which can engulf an entrant. May contain walls that converge inward or floors that slope downward and taper into a smaller area which could trap or asphyxiate an entrant. May contain other serious physical hazards such as unguarded machines or exposed live wires. Must be identified by the employer who must inform exposed employees of the existence and location of such spaces and their hazards. Confined Space PPE It is standard that confined space entrants don: Hearing protection Eye protection Hand protection Hard hats Chemically treated protective garments Respiratory protection, or a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) if necessary Additional PPE may be needed depending on the characteristics of the space, of which your employer is required to provide you with Confined Space Team You must have authorized attendants and supervisors monitoring you while you're in the confined space at all times to offer emergency assistance if needed. Confined Space Eligibility You are eligible to enter the confined space upon successful completion of which should allow you to: Be properly trained on all anticipated hazards of permit-required confined spaces. Know how to use all equipment properly. Know the signs and symptoms of exposure to hazardous atmospheres and how to perform self-rescue. Know the evacuation signal, and understand that the attendant can initiate immediate evacuations requiring all entrants to exit. PPE may be needed depending on the characteristics of the space, of which your employer is required to provide you with.

OSHA says that a permit-required confined space: May contain a hazardous or potentially hazardous atmosphere. May contain a material which can engulf an entrant. May contain walls that converge inward or floors that slope downward and taper into a smaller area which could trap or asphyxiate an entrant. May contain other serious physical hazards such as unguarded machines or exposed live wires. Must be identified by the employer who must inform exposed employees of the existence and location of such spaces and their hazards. Confined Space PPE It is standard that confined space entrants don: Hearing protection Eye protection Hand protection Hard hats Chemically treated protective garments Respiratory protection, or a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) if necessary Additional PPE may be needed depending on the characteristics of the space, of which your employer is required to provide you with Confined Space Team You must have authorized attendants and supervisors monitoring you while you're in the confined space at all times to offer emergency assistance if needed.

Immediately notify others of any (new or old) hazards that you perceive. Be alert to hazards that could affect anyone\u2014 not just yourself; in this respect, maintain a team mentality at all times. Report a hazardous condition immediately to your manager or supervisor. Be conscious as to what others are doing around you, and do your best to ensure you don\u2019t pose a hazard to them (and vice versa). If you\u2019re an employer, invite and involve your employees in safety planning; obtain their insight, give and take suggestions, and ensure that everyone is on the same page. 92% Of Injuries are Sustained by Men In 2010, 92% that had fatal work injuries were men compared to only 8% of women.

(5) 12 Die Every Day Every day, more than 12 workers die on the job \u2013 over 4,500 a year. (7) Always be awake and alert in your workspace. Immediately clean and/or report any potential hazards (spills, leaks, fire hazard\nobstacles) Closely follow instructions when using any tool or machine. Dress appropriately for your specific workspace and/or task. Always wear the protective equipment that is intended for your task. Make safety your first thought\u2014not your afterthought! Over 10,000 Safety Videos Topics Covering All Industries DVDs, Online and Interactive Options Training as low as $89 An Uplifting Thought: Lifting and Climbing Safely Always use both hands when lifting a heavy or cumbersome object. Adopt a proper stance for lifting: put the strain on your legs, not your back (crouch at your feet, keep your back straight, and don\u2019t bend at the waist). Test the weight before you lift something up completely; it might be too late if you realize a few seconds later that it\u2019s too heavy or cumbersome for you. An easy way to do this is to nudge it with your foot first. Consider a back brace if the work is heavy or you have a sensitive back. Move your feet, not your back, when you want to travel or turn while carrying a heavy load. Lift slowly and smoothly. Keep your burden close to your body; this means less strain on you. If your load is too heavy for you to handle alone, don\u2019t be shy\u2014ask for help! Ensure ladders are secure and steady before climbing aboard. Never climb on improvised ladders. Shelves and storage units are poor substitutes. Don\u2019t be lazy, and find a proper solid ladder. Don\u2019t let appearances fool you. Railings might appear solid and fixed, but they might be improperly secures; at least, test them first. Use safety harnesses if your job includes heights. Eliminate distractions when working on a roof, scaffold, or other elevated platform. More than ever, stay focused and alert! Keep an eye out on the floor to ensure it\u2019s free of obstacles and spills. If it isn\u2019t, get cleaning! Tools and Machinery: Putting Safety First Use machinery only if you\u2019re authorized, trained, and alert. Always use the appropriate tool for the respective task. Clean your tools and keep them in good working order. Organize your tools and don\u2019t be careless; someone could easily slip or get hit due to a misplaced object. Always ensure that the operator of a machine sees you; never approach from behind or from a blind side. Do not perform a task unless you\u2019ve been trained and you are aware of the hazards as well as how to mitigate/eliminate them. Never leave machinery running unattended. Never remove safety guards that are in place to protect you and the surrounding area. Obey all operating instructions. If something is wrong, stop the machine immediately and get assistance. Communicate your location and process to those around you, so they\u2019ll know where you are, what you\u2019re doing, and when they need to be getting out of the way. Never walk in front of a forklift, tractor, or any other heavy machine; the operator may not have seen you\u2014and, even if he has, there\u2019s always room for error, so make sure that error isn\u2019t you being trampled. Always read labels and instructions alerting you to potential dangers and hazards. Unless it\u2019s your job, never tamper with electric controls, cords, switches,\u00a0or other such hazardous items. Dress properly and compactly: billowing, loose, or hanging clothes and accessories (ties, earrings, bracelets, loose sleeves, etc.) may easily get caught up in moving parts. At best, the offending objects may be destroyed; at worst, they could ruin the machine or severely\nhurt you. Never insert fingers or any other objects that don\u2019t belong into moving machinery. Turn off machines and equipment before you even consider cleaning, un-jamming, oiling, adjusting, or moving them. Beware of Fire Hazards Come up with a fire emergency plan; ensure that everyone knows and understands it. Practice fire drills. Avoid \u201cpower strips\u201d which can ignite a fire if overloaded. Ventilation is critical, especially if dealing with fumes and chemicals. Good ventilation helps to reduce the toxins in the air, and thus to eliminate highly flammable\nvapors. In case of fire, know what has fed the fire. Never fight a grease fire\u00a0with water; water will splash the oil and spread the flames. Be aware of the whereabouts and use of fire extinguishers. Gearing Up for Safety Always wear appropriate clothing and shoes\u00a0respective to your job. Fire extinguishers must be available and readily attainable. First aid kits must be available and readily attainable. Never remove or tamper with safety devices. Use a back brace if you\u2019re lifting heavy objects or you\u2019ve got a sensitive back. A hard hat will protect you if there\u2019s a risk of falling objects Wear gloves if you\u2019re handling sharp objects or toxic substances. Wear goggles if your work poses a hazard to your eyes. Wear safety harnesses if you\u2019re working from an elevated location and there\u2019s the risk of falling. Wear non-skid footgear: If your workspace involves slippery surfaces (kitchens, spas, pools, etc.) If you\u2019re lifting heavy items Wear a breathing mask at all times, especially if: You deal with dangerous or toxic chemicals or fumes Your workspace has poor ventilation Your workspace has debris, dust, and other flying particles.

Minimize headache and fatigue by following these office safety\n                        tips: Providing enough ventilation Blocking exterior pollution (traffic pollution, etc.) and interior fumes (exhaust from printing\n                        machines, etc.) Adjusting lighting (not too bright and not too dim) Reducing glare (dull paint finishes, indirect lighting) Muffling noise (carpeting, curtains, insulation, reduced volume for telephone ringers and\n                        beeping equipment) Poor Wrist Ergonomics Are Responsible for Most Office Injuries Of the 92,576\n                            injuries or illnesses due to repetitive motion including typing or key entry, 55% affected\n                            the wrist, 7% affected the shoulder, and 6% affected the back. (3) Poor Ergonomics Frequently Leads To Days Away From Work For cases involving days\n                            away from work, BLS reports that in 1994 approximately 32% of the cases were the result of\n                            overexertion or repetitive motion. (3) More than 350,000 injuries are reported annually due to\n                                overexertion in lifting. (3) Keep your workspace clean, organized, and free of obstacles. Be aware of all emergency exits and ensure easy access. Know the medical conditions, allergies, or needs of your co-workers, and understand what you\n                            can do to help in a time of need; ensure that they also know and understand your needs. Fix or report any hazards immediately. Know and practice emergency plans, especially for emergencies that are likely or probable\n                            according to your workspace and region. Watch for Potential Danger Fix or report torn carpeting, loose floorboards or tiles, or otherwise unstable\n                        surfaces. Fix or report broken furniture, burnt-out light-bulbs or other appliances, and\n                    other defective equipment. Look out for frayed, torn, or otherwise damaged\u00a0electrical cords,\n                    cables, etc. Keep floors and walkways clear of cords; coil excess cables or use cable ties to keep them out of\n                    the way. Remove obstructions in walkways and (especially) exits. Safety signs and exit signs should be clearly marked and easily seen. Never touch electrical switches, outlets, or plugs with wet hands. Fix or report fire hazards; check the sprinkler system, renew\n                    batteries for smoke detectors, have fire extinguishers on-hand. Use flame-retardant materials. Label and safely store all combustible items and fluids. Prepare for Emergencies Know the specific evacuation plans and guidelines\u2014 especially for natural\n                    disasters or conditions (fires, earthquakes, floods, tornados, etc.) that are typical or probable in\n                    your area. Weather shelters (i.e. for tornados) must be properly equipped, clean, of easy access, and large\n                    enough to accommodate everyone. Practice regular drills for each type specific emergency. Be familiar with all emergency exits and how to access them. Ensure your office has marshals, fire guards, or security personnel\u00a0for\n                    times of need. Create strategies in case of more common and universal issues:\u00a0power\n                    outages, network failures, etc. ---- Office Safety Tips: Sources ---- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)"

In the case of safety awareness month, much of our safety training could be shared with family members to help keep them safe as well. As of 2018, . While math is not my strong suit, this is pretty easy. If you spend $1 per employee per month on training, but they share the training with their 2.14 family members, you are getting a whole lot of value for that dollar! (See how I skipped the math in that example?) Safety Training for Home and Work In honor of June being safety awareness month, here are a few examples of HSI safety training videos that have applications both at work and home. Driving Safety The obvious targets for this topic are your drivers who handle deliveries, maintenance, grounds keeping, and salespeople. In most US cities, the majority of your employees commute to work by driving themselves. Our courses cover distracted driving (please put your phone in the trunk while you drive), bad weather basics and alcohol and substance abuse. Don\u2019t you think your teenagers might benefit from this information as well? Fire Extinguisher Safety Yes, any employee working around machinery and power tools needs to receive training on fire extinguisher safety. Your office employees may have secret space heaters, overloaded extension cords, or they may inadvertently stacked combustible materials (files and papers) too high and too close to a sprinkler. All employees could benefit from fire extinguisher training. Everyone in your family should also know the locations of all the fire extinguishers. (Personally, I have two, along with two fire ladders.) The units should be easily accessible and not be buried under the clutter in your kitchen pantry or garage. Check the class (A, B, C, D, or F?) and review how to pull the pin, aim, and squeeze. While you\u2019re at it, check the expiration dates. Not only will your 3.14 family members be grateful, so will your . Electrical Safety In your workplace, your electrical safety training should cover PPE, grounding, arc flash, wiring, GFCI, and OSHA requirements. These courses typically apply to maintenance and warehouse workers, and the construction and real estate development sectors. All employees can benefit from some general electrical safety training that covers how to avoid electrical hazards, how to identify a lock or tag on an electrical panel, proper use of surge protectors, and to be alert for damaged cords. Employees (and family members) should know when to speak up. If you see something, say something. A colleague was plugging a Roku unit into an outlet in her home that was hidden by a TV mounted on the wall. When she touched the outlet it was so hot, it felt like it burned her fingertip. When she removed the TV from the wall, she found the outlet was slowly melting from the inside. A clear fire hazard. She flipped the breaker to that room, called an electrician. They found faulty wiring. More Safety Tips for Home and Work Slips, Trips, and Falls Watch out for ice, water, grease, or debris that may cause slips. Watch out for clutter in aisles or walkways, extension cords, hoses, open drawers, and boxes, all of which are trip hazards. Pay extra attention when working on a ladder or walking down the stairs. Carbon Monoxide Also known as the silent killer, carbon monoxide is an odorless gas. In the workplace, risks come from internal combustion engines you find in forklifts and diesel engines. At home, carbon monoxide can come from anything like a heater, clothes dryer, or fireplace. It\u2019s pretty simple to install a carbon monoxide detector in your home: plug it in. And check the batteries. Personal Protective Equipment PPE in the workplace can include hardhats, face shields, goggles, coveralls, and safety shoes. Basically, anything you wear to protect you from workplace hazards. PPE at home might include wearing gloves when working with paint or chemicals. Or wearing closed-toe shoes and sunglasses when you cut the grass, not flip flops! You need to be prepared when a shard of wood comes flying out at your foot or face. Emergency Exits Training on emergency exits is about situational awareness. Knowing where the exits are located will help you make the right decision in the moment. At work, home, sporting events, movie theaters, concerts, etc. My colleague reads spy thrillers.

More \u2013 children as well as adults \u2013 are injured at home. But preventing accidents in the home and at work needn\u2019t be difficult, time-consuming or expensive. Many improvements can be made using only common sense. Keep the floor clear. Don\u2019t use corridors and stairways for storage, they make it easy for people to trip and fall badly. Boxes in passageways also block your escape in a fire or emergency - and that could be fatal. Carry carefully. Think before picking up something large or heavy. A back injury can last for life. Use a trolley or conveyor instead. Chemicals. Every home and workplace has toxic chemicals that can kill \u2013 bleach, fertilizer, cleaning materials. They should be clearly labelled, in a language everyone understands, with basic information about their properties. And they should be securely stored so children can\u2019t reach them. First Aid. A basic first aid kit is not expensive. Make sure it\u2019s easily available and that you know what it contains and how to use it. The right on-the-spot treatment can make a big difference. Take precautions. Personal protective equipment like gloves, shoes, masks, goggles and hard hats doesn\u2019t have to be expensive but can save you from serious injury in the home, fields or office, so get into the habit of using them. Domestic and work machines should be fitted with protective guards. Electricity can be lethal. Don\u2019t let electric cables lie loose on the floor. All electrical machinery - domestic and industrial - should be well earthed. Work smart. Whether you\u2019re cooking at home, sitting at a computer, or standing mixing and assembling products make sure you are comfortable. Standing or sitting, worktops are best at elbow height. Chairs should have supporting backrests. Don\u2019t sit on the floor to work or cook \u2013 it\u2019s bad for your back as well as being dirty and unsafe. Pure, fresh drinking water should be easily and plentifully available. Washing and toilet facilities need to be clean and convenient, with soap, towels and separate facilities for men and women. Give yourself a break. Working long hours without a rest makes people less productive and more likely to have accidents or make mistakes. It\u2019s easier to stay alert if you introduce some variety into your tasks rather than monotonously performing the same action. You\u2019ll develop new skills too. Light and air. Good light and fresh air help you stay alert and cut down unhealthy build-ups of chemicals and dirt. Better ventilation and a proper, insulating ceiling can pay for themselves with reduced heating and air con bills. Be aware that elderly people, the disabled, pregnant women, young and inexperienced workers have special needs in health and safety, as in other things. Systems are the key to safety. Make good health and safety practices part of your daily habits at home and at work, 365 days a year.

        "markdown": "Share Share Link Close shareCopy link Accidents happen anywhere, whether at home or in the workplace, often when we least expect them. Although it\u2019s impossible to completely eliminate all risks, taking proactive steps to prevent accidents is essential to protect yourself, your family, and your colleagues. Implementing safety measures not only reduces the risk of injuries but also creates environments where everyone feels secure. This guide will explore a variety of safety measures that can be implemented at home and in the workplace to prevent accidents and create a safer, healthier environment. While these suggestions are helpful, always consult professionals and ensure you are compliant with local regulations regarding safety practices. Safety Measures at Home 1. Install and Maintain Smoke Alarms One of the most critical safety devices in any home is the smoke alarm. It provides early detection in the event of a fire, giving you crucial time to evacuate. Ensure you install smoke alarms on every level of your home, especially in bedrooms and hallways. Smoke alarms should be interconnected if possible\u2014when one alarm sounds, they all sound, giving every occupant time to react. Test your smoke alarms monthly, and replace the batteries at least once a year. 2. Create and Practice a Fire Escape Plan In addition to smoke alarms, having a fire escape plan is essential. Sit down with your family and identify two escape routes from every room. Establish a designated meeting spot outside the house where everyone should gather in case of an emergency. Conduct regular fire drills to ensure that everyone knows the plan and can react quickly under pressure. 3. Use Electrical Safety Precautions Faulty electrical systems and misuse of electrical appliances are common causes of household fires. Regularly inspect electrical cords for signs of wear and tear, and replace damaged cords immediately. Avoid overloading electrical outlets, as this can cause overheating and spark fires. Unplug appliances when they\u2019re not in use, and consider using surge protectors to safeguard your electronics. Teach children about electrical safety, and keep them away from outlets, cords, and electrical devices. 4. Prevent Slips, Trips, and Falls Slips, trips, and falls are among the most common causes of household injuries. Keep your walkways clear of clutter and ensure they are well-lit. Use non-slip mats in areas prone to water, such as bathrooms and kitchens, and secure loose rugs to the floor to prevent slipping. Install handrails along staircases and ramps, and regularly inspect your home for any potential hazards, such as uneven flooring or damaged steps. 5. Secure Hazardous Materials Many common household products, such as cleaning supplies, medications, and chemicals, can be hazardous if misused or ingested. Store these items securely, out of the reach of children and pets. Ensure that all hazardous materials are properly labeled and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use and disposal. It\u2019s also important to lock away sharp objects, firearms, or anything that could cause injury if mishandled. 6. Install Carbon Monoxide Detectors Carbon monoxide (CO) is a silent threat\u2014an odorless, colorless gas that can be lethal if inhaled in large amounts. Install carbon monoxide detectors near bedrooms and on each level of your home to monitor for dangerous CO levels. Regularly check the detectors\u2019 batteries and have fuel-burning appliances serviced by professionals to prevent leaks. 7. Childproof Your Home If you have young children, childproofing your home is a must. Install safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs, secure heavy furniture to walls to prevent tipping, and use outlet covers to block access to electrical sockets. Keep hazards, small objects, and toxic substances out of reach. Installing locks on cabinets and securing windows can further ensure your child\u2019s safety. 8. Maintain Proper Lighting Inside and Outside Proper lighting is key to preventing accidents both inside and outside your home. Ensure that all hallways, staircases, and entrances are well-lit, and replace burnt-out bulbs immediately. Outside, use motion-sensor lights to illuminate pathways and entry points, which can help deter potential accidents or intrusions. 9. Secure Outdoor Areas Outdoor safety is just as important as indoor safety. Ensure that your deck, patio, or balcony has secure railings, and check for any weak spots or loose boards that could pose a tripping hazard. If you have a pool, install a fence with a locking gate around it to prevent unsupervised access, especially for children. 10. Ensure Proper Ventilation Proper ventilation in your home is crucial, especially in areas like the kitchen and bathroom where moisture and fumes can accumulate. Without proper ventilation, mold and mildew can develop, creating health risks. Install exhaust fans in these areas, and regularly clean air ducts and filters to maintain air quality. 11. Check Appliances for Safety Regularly inspecting your household appliances can help prevent potential hazards. Appliances like stoves, water heaters, and space heaters should be inspected by professionals to ensure they are operating correctly. Faulty appliances can cause fires, carbon monoxide leaks, or electrical hazards. 12. Develop a First Aid Kit Every home should have a fully stocked that includes bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, tweezers, scissors, and more. Make sure everyone in your household knows where the kit is located and how to use its contents in case of an emergency. 13. Practice Safe Cooking Habits Cooking accidents are one of the leading causes of household fires. Never leave food unattended while cooking, especially when frying or grilling. Keep flammable items like towels, paper, and cooking oil away from heat sources. Have a fire extinguisher nearby and know how to use it in case a small fire breaks out. Safety Measures in the Workplace 14. Develop a Comprehensive Safety Program A well-structured occupational safety program is the foundation of any safe workplace. This program should include policies, procedures, and training that focus on preventing accidents. Designate a safety officer or team to oversee the implementation of the program and ensure that employees are aware of safety protocols. 15. Conduct Regular Safety Inspections Workplace hazards can arise unexpectedly, so regular safety inspections and risk assessments are necessary to identify and eliminate potential risks. Look for issues like blocked emergency exits, faulty electrical equipment, slip hazards, and improperly stored chemicals. Address any safety concerns promptly to prevent accidents. 16. Provide Safety Training for Employees Ensure that all employees receive proper training in workplace safety, especially those who work with heavy machinery or hazardous materials. Offer training on safe lifting techniques, emergency procedures, proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other relevant safety practices. Regular refresher courses should be conducted to keep safety knowledge up to date. Implement an Emergency Response Plan to Prevent Workplace Accidents Every workplace should have an emergency response plan that covers situations such as fires, natural disasters, medical emergencies, and chemical spills. Health administration plays a crucial role in developing and implementing effective emergency response plans. Train employees on evacuation routes, assembly points, and procedures for contacting emergency services. Regularly conduct to ensure that employees know how to respond in a crisis. 18. Maintain Ergonomic Workstations Ergonomics is critical in preventing workplace injuries, particularly musculoskeletal disorders caused by poor posture or repetitive movements. Provide adjustable chairs, ergonomic keyboards, and monitor stands to ensure employees are comfortable and supported. Encourage workers to take regular breaks to stretch and move around to reduce the risk of strain. Proper ergonomics can significantly reduce workplace accidents by minimizing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. 19. Promote Good Housekeeping Practices Good housekeeping is fundamental to workplace safety. Keep workspaces clean and free of clutter, and ensure that walkways are clear of obstructions. Immediately clean up spills and dispose of waste properly. Regularly inspect tools, equipment, and machinery to ensure they are in good working order. Good housekeeping practices are essential to prevent accidents in the workplace. 20. Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Personal protective equipment is a key component of workplace safety, particularly in high-risk environments. Ensure that employees have access to and use appropriate PPE, such as helmets, gloves, safety goggles, and ear protection. Provide training on the proper use and maintenance of PPE to ensure it remains effective. Proper use of PPE can prevent numerous workplace injuries. 21. Maintain Clear and Accessible Emergency Exits Emergency exits should always be clearly marked and free from obstructions. Ensure that all employees know the location of these exits and understand how to use them in case of an emergency. Regularly inspect exit routes to ensure they are safe and functional. Clear emergency exits are crucial for the quick evacuation of an injured employee. 22. Encourage Open Communication About Safety Concerns Creating a culture of open communication around safety helps prevent accidents. Encourage employees to report any hazards, near-misses, or safety concerns without fear of retaliation. Implement a system for addressing these concerns promptly and make necessary improvements based on employee feedback. Open communication can also help in conducting a thorough risk assessment. 23. Manage Stress and Mental Health in the Workplace Stress and mental health issues can contribute to workplace accidents by impairing focus and decision-making. Implement programs that promote mental health, such as stress management workshops, mental health days, and access to counseling services. Encourage employees to take breaks when needed and create an environment that values work-life balance. 24. Ensure Proper Signage and Labels Clear signage and labeling are essential for maintaining safety in the workplace. Use signs to mark hazardous areas, restricted zones, emergency exits, and PPE requirements. Labels should be placed on chemicals, machinery, and other hazardous materials to inform employees of the risks and proper handling procedures. 25. Provide Safe Equipment and Tools Ensuring that all equipment and tools are in good working condition is a critical aspect of workplace safety. Regularly inspect and maintain machinery to prevent malfunctions that could lead to accidents. Train employees on the proper use of tools and machinery to avoid misuse that could result in injury. 26. Ensure Safe Lifting Practices Back injuries from improper lifting are common in workplaces that involve manual labor. Train employees on safe lifting techniques, such as bending the knees, keeping the back straight, and lifting with the legs. Provide equipment like dollies and lifting straps to assist with heavy loads. 27. Provide Adequate Rest Breaks Fatigue is a significant contributor to workplace accidents, particularly in industries that require long hours or physical labor. Ensure that employees are given adequate rest breaks throughout the day to prevent fatigue-related accidents. Encourage hydration and healthy eating during breaks to maintain energy levels. 28. Secure Hazardous Substances Workplaces that handle hazardous substances must implement strict protocols for their storage and handling. Ensure that chemicals, flammable materials, and other hazardous substances are stored in secure areas with proper ventilation. Employees should be trained on the safe handling and disposal of these materials to avoid spills, fires, or exposure. 29. Monitor Indoor Air Quality Indoor air quality can have a significant impact on employee health and productivity. Poor ventilation or the presence of harmful chemicals can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems. Regularly monitor air quality and maintain ventilation systems to ensure a clean and healthy work environment. 30. Use Technology to Enhance Safety Advancements in technology can greatly enhance workplace safety.

        "html": "Share Share Link Close share Copy link Accidents happen anywhere, whether at home or in the workplace, often when we least expect them. Although it\u2019s impossible to completely eliminate all risks, taking proactive steps to prevent accidents is essential to protect yourself, your family, and your colleagues. Implementing safety measures not only reduces the risk of injuries but also creates environments where everyone feels secure. This guide will explore a variety of safety measures that can be implemented at home and in the workplace to prevent accidents and create a safer, healthier environment. While these suggestions are helpful, always consult professionals and ensure you are compliant with local regulations regarding safety practices. Safety Measures at Home 1. Install and Maintain Smoke Alarms One of the most critical safety devices in any home is the smoke alarm. It provides early detection in the event of a fire, giving you crucial time to evacuate. Ensure you install smoke alarms on every level of your home, especially in bedrooms and hallways. Smoke alarms should be interconnected if possible\u2014when one alarm sounds, they all sound, giving every occupant time to react. Test your smoke alarms monthly, and replace the batteries at least once a year. 2. Create and Practice a Fire Escape Plan In addition to smoke alarms, having a fire escape plan is essential. Sit down with your family and identify two escape routes from every room. Establish a designated meeting spot outside the house where everyone should gather in case of an emergency. Conduct regular fire drills to ensure that everyone knows the plan and can react quickly under pressure. 3. Use Electrical Safety Precautions Faulty electrical systems and misuse of electrical appliances are common causes of household fires. Regularly inspect electrical cords for signs of wear and tear, and replace damaged cords immediately. Avoid overloading electrical outlets, as this can cause overheating and spark fires. Unplug appliances when they\u2019re not in use, and consider using surge protectors to safeguard your electronics. Teach children about electrical safety, and keep them away from outlets, cords, and electrical devices. 4. Prevent Slips, Trips, and Falls Slips, trips, and falls are among the most common causes of household injuries. Keep your walkways clear of clutter and ensure they are well-lit. Use non-slip mats in areas prone to water, such as bathrooms and kitchens, and secure loose rugs to the floor to prevent slipping. Install handrails along staircases and ramps, and regularly inspect your home for any potential hazards, such as uneven flooring or damaged steps. 5. Secure Hazardous Materials Many common household products, such as cleaning supplies, medications, and chemicals, can be hazardous if misused or ingested. Store these items securely, out of the reach of children and pets. Ensure that all hazardous materials are properly labeled and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use and disposal. It\u2019s also important to lock away sharp objects, firearms, or anything that could cause injury if mishandled. 6. Install Carbon Monoxide Detectors Carbon monoxide (CO) is a silent threat\u2014an odorless, colorless gas that can be lethal if inhaled in large amounts. Install carbon monoxide detectors near bedrooms and on each level of your home to monitor for dangerous CO levels. Regularly check the detectors\u2019 batteries and have fuel-burning appliances serviced by professionals to prevent leaks. 7. Childproof Your Home If you have young children, childproofing your home is a must. Install safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs, secure heavy furniture to walls to prevent tipping, and use outlet covers to block access to electrical sockets. Keep hazards, small objects, and toxic substances out of reach. Installing locks on cabinets and securing windows can further ensure your child\u2019s safety. 8. Maintain Proper Lighting Inside and Outside Proper lighting is key to preventing accidents both inside and outside your home. Ensure that all hallways, staircases, and entrances are well-lit, and replace burnt-out bulbs immediately. Outside, use motion-sensor lights to illuminate pathways and entry points, which can help deter potential accidents or intrusions. 9. Secure Outdoor Areas Outdoor safety is just as important as indoor safety. Ensure that your deck, patio, or balcony has secure railings, and check for any weak spots or loose boards that could pose a tripping hazard. If you have a pool, install a fence with a locking gate around it to prevent unsupervised access, especially for children. 10. Ensure Proper Ventilation Proper ventilation in your home is crucial, especially in areas like the kitchen and bathroom where moisture and fumes can accumulate. Without proper ventilation, mold and mildew can develop, creating health risks. Install exhaust fans in these areas, and regularly clean air ducts and filters to maintain air quality. 11. Check Appliances for Safety Regularly inspecting your household appliances can help prevent potential hazards. Appliances like stoves, water heaters, and space heaters should be inspected by professionals to ensure they are operating correctly. Faulty appliances can cause fires, carbon monoxide leaks, or electrical hazards. 12. Develop a First Aid Kit Every home should have a fully stocked that includes bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, tweezers, scissors, and more. Make sure everyone in your household knows where the kit is located and how to use its contents in case of an emergency. 13. Practice Safe Cooking Habits Cooking accidents are one of the leading causes of household fires. Never leave food unattended while cooking, especially when frying or grilling. Keep flammable items like towels, paper, and cooking oil away from heat sources. Have a fire extinguisher nearby and know how to use it in case a small fire breaks out. Safety Measures in the Workplace 14. Develop a Comprehensive Safety Program A well-structured occupational safety program is the foundation of any safe workplace. This program should include policies, procedures, and training that focus on preventing accidents. Designate a safety officer or team to oversee the implementation of the program and ensure that employees are aware of safety protocols. 15. Conduct Regular Safety Inspections Workplace hazards can arise unexpectedly, so regular safety inspections and risk assessments are necessary to identify and eliminate potential risks. Look for issues like blocked emergency exits, faulty electrical equipment, slip hazards, and improperly stored chemicals. Address any safety concerns promptly to prevent accidents. 16. Provide Safety Training for Employees Ensure that all employees receive proper training in workplace safety, especially those who work with heavy machinery or hazardous materials. Offer training on safe lifting techniques, emergency procedures, proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other relevant safety practices. Regular refresher courses should be conducted to keep safety knowledge up to date. Implement an Emergency Response Plan to Prevent Workplace Accidents Every workplace should have an emergency response plan that covers situations such as fires, natural disasters, medical emergencies, and chemical spills. Health administration plays a crucial role in developing and implementing effective emergency response plans. Train employees on evacuation routes, assembly points, and procedures for contacting emergency services. Regularly conduct to ensure that employees know how to respond in a crisis. 18. Maintain Ergonomic Workstations Ergonomics is critical in preventing workplace injuries, particularly musculoskeletal disorders caused by poor posture or repetitive movements. Provide adjustable chairs, ergonomic keyboards, and monitor stands to ensure employees are comfortable and supported. Encourage workers to take regular breaks to stretch and move around to reduce the risk of strain. Proper ergonomics can significantly reduce workplace accidents by minimizing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. 19. Promote Good Housekeeping Practices Good housekeeping is fundamental to workplace safety. Keep workspaces clean and free of clutter, and ensure that walkways are clear of obstructions. Immediately clean up spills and dispose of waste properly. Regularly inspect tools, equipment, and machinery to ensure they are in good working order. Good housekeeping practices are essential to prevent accidents in the workplace. 20. Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Personal protective equipment is a key component of workplace safety, particularly in high-risk environments. Ensure that employees have access to and use appropriate PPE, such as helmets, gloves, safety goggles, and ear protection. Provide training on the proper use and maintenance of PPE to ensure it remains effective. Proper use of PPE can prevent numerous workplace injuries. 21. Maintain Clear and Accessible Emergency Exits Emergency exits should always be clearly marked and free from obstructions. Ensure that all employees know the location of these exits and understand how to use them in case of an emergency. Regularly inspect exit routes to ensure they are safe and functional. Clear emergency exits are crucial for the quick evacuation of an injured employee. 22. Encourage Open Communication About Safety Concerns Creating a culture of open communication around safety helps prevent accidents. Encourage employees to report any hazards, near-misses, or safety concerns without fear of retaliation. Implement a system for addressing these concerns promptly and make necessary improvements based on employee feedback. Open communication can also help in conducting a thorough risk assessment. 23. Manage Stress and Mental Health in the Workplace Stress and mental health issues can contribute to workplace accidents by impairing focus and decision-making. Implement programs that promote mental health, such as stress management workshops, mental health days, and access to counseling services. Encourage employees to take breaks when needed and create an environment that values work-life balance. 24. Ensure Proper Signage and Labels Clear signage and labeling are essential for maintaining safety in the workplace. Use signs to mark hazardous areas, restricted zones, emergency exits, and PPE requirements. Labels should be placed on chemicals, machinery, and other hazardous materials to inform employees of the risks and proper handling procedures. 25. Provide Safe Equipment and Tools Ensuring that all equipment and tools are in good working condition is a critical aspect of workplace safety. Regularly inspect and maintain machinery to prevent malfunctions that could lead to accidents. Train employees on the proper use of tools and machinery to avoid misuse that could result in injury. 26. Ensure Safe Lifting Practices Back injuries from improper lifting are common in workplaces that involve manual labor. Train employees on safe lifting techniques, such as bending the knees, keeping the back straight, and lifting with the legs. Provide equipment like dollies and lifting straps to assist with heavy loads. 27. Provide Adequate Rest Breaks Fatigue is a significant contributor to workplace accidents, particularly in industries that require long hours or physical labor. Ensure that employees are given adequate rest breaks throughout the day to prevent fatigue-related accidents. Encourage hydration and healthy eating during breaks to maintain energy levels. 28. Secure Hazardous Substances Workplaces that handle hazardous substances must implement strict protocols for their storage and handling. Ensure that chemicals, flammable materials, and other hazardous substances are stored in secure areas with proper ventilation. Employees should be trained on the safe handling and disposal of these materials to avoid spills, fires, or exposure. 29. Monitor Indoor Air Quality Indoor air quality can have a significant impact on employee health and productivity. Poor ventilation or the presence of harmful chemicals can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems. Regularly monitor air quality and maintain ventilation systems to ensure a clean and healthy work environment. 30. Use Technology to Enhance Safety Advancements in technology can greatly enhance workplace safety. Use monitoring systems to detect equipment malfunctions, wearable technology to monitor employee health, and software to track safety incidents and trends. Implementing technology can help prevent accidents and create a safer, more efficient workplace. Conclusion Preventing accidents, whether at home or in the workplace, requires a proactive and comprehensive approach. By implementing these safety measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and create safer environments for everyone involved. Always stay informed about safety regulations, regularly assess potential hazards, and ensure that everyone in your home or workplace is educated on safety protocols. Taking these steps will not only protect yourself and those around you but also contribute to a culture of safety and well-being.

If a person is hurt or killed on the job, beyond the immeasurable grief of losing an employee, there is also downtime, loss of man hours, a payout for compensation and recovery, OSHA fines, and possible legal action. The National Safety Council (NSC) shows that businesses spend nearly $170 billion per year on costs associated with occupational injuries and illnesses \u2013 expenditures that come straight out of company profits. Additionally, research has shown a direct correlation between safety and productivity. When safety performance increases, operational performance, machine speed, and utilization increase as well, including as much as 5 to 7 percent higher OEE and 2 to 4 percent less unscheduled downtime. Plus, the root cause of productivity loss often points back to an unsafe machine state. With almost 75 percent of U.S. manufacturing facilities more than 20 years old, there are a great number of older machines in use in the U.S. This means that many machines do not have the proper guarding, controls, or utility systems to meet today's safe machine standards, and most original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) do not support upgrades to achieve a safe machine state. Thus, safety programs aren\u2019t just a cost; they are an investment and an insurance policy. Getting Started with a Safety Risk Assessment Whether your Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) program has been in place for years, or it is in its infancy, the program must be designed to address workplace safety and health hazards on an ongoing basis. While one of your most important goals is likely to eliminate or reduce the chance of error or injury when employees work with heavy, high-speed manufacturing tools and high-voltage equipment, do you know where to start? One of the first steps in developing your safety strategy is to identify potential hazards that currently exist. This covers anything from oil or water leaking in walkways to warehouse shelving hazards. This step is typically an internal audit-level exercise or risk assessment conducted by evaluating various historical incident metrics in all areas of the manufacturing facility coupled with your safety strategy. You also need to establish tolerable ranges for risk, assign these values to machine hazards throughout the facility, and assign an acceptable risk value that should be achieved through a well-defined mitigation and validation process. The written risk assessment is the most fundamental component of any machine safety project and is referenced regularly throughout the life of your company\u2019s safety program. This document provides the overall safety project roadmap to be followed by engineering solution providers like Polytron. Just as with any investment, you may want to diversify your machine safety upgrades while meeting the objectives of your EHS program. Some companies apply a strategy of immediate machine safety projects based on risk rating \u2013 the higher the risk, the more immediate mitigative action is taken. Implementation and Training Once equipment safety updates and modifications are made to reduce all identified hazards, the equipment is like a new piece of machinery as safety-rated components were added, technology and software were integrated into machine operations, and isolated safety zones were created. Training employees how to operate and maintain the \u201cnew\u201d equipment is critical to everyone\u2019s safety and operational improvement. Our proven roadmap (below) outlines our approach to machine safety including: Defining how to address hazards with a detailed solution that considers all applicable regulatory and safety standards. The definition should include the scope, preliminary hardware and software identification, budget, preliminary schedule, and training. Design specification that shows all safety equipment, software, and hardware to be applied and any machinery changes to be made. Implementation of the design. Testing and validating every element of the newly designed safety technology. Developing a Technology Transfer and Training Plan Risk mitigation creates necessary change for everyone's protection, and in many cases, provides operational improvement. As a critical part of the machine safety roadmap, we develop a specific technology transfer and training plan to ensure that any worker involved with operating the newly upgraded machine is properly trained on the changes made. In other words, we approach machinery upgrades as \"new equipment.\" Without training, the operator would continue to shut down the machine as before, creating unnecessary downtime and unsafe actions. With effective training, the upgrades, and a retrained workforce, often deliver greater productivity than before the safety upgrade. After the first steps are taken, a full plan is developed that outlines the specifications, behaviors, and measurement criteria for the company. The plan items include: Safety Rules Employee Responsibilities Safety and Training New Employee, Contractor and Visitor Orientation Incident Investigation and Reporting Personal Protective Equipment Emergency Action Plan Safety Discipline (violation policies) Employee Confirmation of Safety Program Creating a Culture of Safety A culture of safety doesn\u2019t just have an impact on accident reduction, it also has an impact on the entire manufacturing process. Some manufacturers run for years without an incident because of their safety culture. They are the best in the industry, not only for their safety, but because of their resulting efficiency. Manufacturers with a safety culture have less turnover, less absenteeism, and higher productivity. Establishing safety and health management programs can reduce your injury and illness costs by 20 to 40 percent. In today's market, that could mean the difference between thriving or surviving. Simply stated, \"Every worker has the right to go home safe and healthy every day and .\" This was the driving force that resulted in the passing of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). This agency was created to set and enforce protective workplace safety and health standards and has a vision to significantly reduce safety and health hazards in U.S. workplaces. In our blog, I review how to establish and launch a safety program, but I will touch on some of the key points here as well. A safety mission/values statement , which means the principles the company lives by, and a safety program , which sets engagement rules, are the beginning steps to creating a culture of safety that are generally driven by the executive office along with the EHS officer or human resources.\u00a0These are designed to be woven into the very fabric of the organization, whether on the plant floor or in administrative offices and are for everyone that conducts work on behalf of the company, including temporary workers. Examples of safety-focused vision statements Include: \"Our vision is to have colleagues, contractors, and visitors return home safely at the end of each day.\" \"We have the right to work in a safe environment.\" \"We will provide the leadership necessary to create a culture in which all employees accept personal responsibility for workplace safety and health.\" \"We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees.\" Safety and health principles should also be established. A sample list might look as follows: Provide workers with a safe work environment. Demonstrate that work is never so urgent that we cannot take time to do it safely. Demonstrate alignment with the safety mission in both words and actions. Ensure accountability at all levels of supervision for safety performance. Provide on-going property conservation practices. Provide personal protective equipment. Develop and implement safe work procedures and rules. Encourage raising concerns about hazards by everyone. Provide ongoing safety training. Conduct routine/regular workplace inspections. Enforce safety rules and appropriate discipline. Include safety as a performance measurement for all employees. To build a\u00a0safety program,\u00a0we recommend focusing on the three supporting areas of prevention, capability, and compliance . Prevention gives insight into setting a prevention goal that can be achieved based on basic safety changes, procedural changes, and more in-depth habits and technologies. Implementing easy to follow policies and hazard prevention are key concepts. Capability usually proves to be the biggest surprise for representatives as they gain an understanding of passive awareness, proactive engagement, and skill-driven engagement. Culture change starts with orientation and continues with formal and informal training opportunities and employee-driven awards that focus on catching someone in the act of \u201cdoing something right\u201d rather than the \u201cnumber of accident-free days.\u201d Compliance focuses on benchmarking and leveraging internal and external best practices, providing easy access to safety requirements, and having simple auditing and tracking methods in place. Getting Employees Involved The biggest hurdle in starting a culture of safety is getting everyone to buy-in to the idea that safety is an investment with real bottom-line benefits. Myths, stories, attitudes, norms, assumptions, and beliefs all stand in the way of getting the acceptance facilities need to develop a culture of safety. Signs, billboards, reports, and incentives can help, but in the end, the people who run the business will be your greatest asset if they know how to ensure each other\u2019s safety. Safety systems can be as simple as including safety conversations in existing meetings and a comment box, but no safety system will be successful without universal buy-in. Safety brings organizations together because everyone can work toward a common goal and improve a business\u2019 bottom line. To successfully improve a facility\u2019s safety record, there needs to be support from leadership, shared responsibilities, clear communication, and continuous improvement. Everyone must take responsibility, but the trend starts with management. If leaders don\u2019t demonstrate an active commitment to safety, nobody will. Supporting Change for a Culture of Safety To get through the initial barriers, personnel should understand why they are being asked to change what they normally do and to trust their leadership to follow through with support. Employees need to know that if they take action or speak up, they will be rewarded, not punished. There needs to be consistent support and positive reinforcement from leadership. Safety should be part of the operational fabric of a facility. That means doing things like discussing safety at the start of meetings and holding leaders accountable for safety performance. Additionally, these measures might break down organizational barriers such as fear and lack of trust. Employees should still use the chain of command, but they shouldn\u2019t have to face repercussions for speaking up. Supervisors and managers should be held accountable for their responsiveness when issues are raised. Communicating Safety Changing organizational behavior is the goal of creating a culture of safety. The continued success of a safety program hinges upon everyone\u2019s ability to clearly communicate their thoughts and intentions and act accordingly. Clear and constructive safety communication improves understanding, prevents at-risk behaviors, and enhances safe work practices. A Plan to Act can provide the procedures personnel should follow when they encounter an unsafe scenario. A safety committee that includes production teams, managers, and supervisors who can ensure responsibilities are distributed among everyone should also be established. The safety committee promotes safety awareness and reduces the potential for injury/loss at all levels of the company. The committees hold individuals accountable for meeting the goals outlined in safety reports. Leadership\u2019s directives, guidance, and training should show the committee what the right decisions are and how to make the right decision when individuals recognize an unsafe scenario. Leadership is also responsible for safety committee oversight. Formalizing a Safety Plan As mentioned, a safety program should start with a of all equipment in the facility, using a standardized method and data capture tool to ensure all machines receive the same review and that no item is left unchecked. Safety goals should be clearly defined within safety reports that are substantiated with accurate data. Overemphasis on bottom line performance, such as the accident rate, can drive accident reporting under the table. However, reporting minor incidents and near misses is important and will require additional training, attention, and time for input. With more in-depth, accurate reporting, incident rates will appear to rise initially, but it will level off and decline as safety system changes take hold. Accuracy in reporting is important because OSHA violations can carry serious consequences. According to the NSC, \"Establishing safety as a value rather than a priority tells our employees and our customers that safety is built into our culture, not something we do to merely comply with regulations.\" What this means for manufacturers is that OSHA will show up unannounced and conduct a comprehensive wall-to-wall inspection of the facility in their jurisdiction. Why? This is a local enforcement strategy designed to address issues in industries that pose a particularly high risk to workers. This differs from an incident inspection where OSHA is only interested in the area involved with the reported incident or hazard reported by a worker. Many of the are focused on specific equipment such as powered industrial trucks or hazardous respiratory conditions like breathing silica dust. If OSHA Knocked on Your Door Today, Are You Ready? As an employer, you have a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for your employees, contractors, temporary workers, and visitors. A good starting point for this might be to ask, \"Are we aligned as an organization for safety standards, communications, and training?\" If the answer is not 100 percent \u201cyes.\u201d then there is an opportunity to make a commitment to safety at the highest level of the company. Below are some of the signs that an operation may not be in compliance: Lack of continuous emphasis on safety Wages paid to injured workers for absences not covered by workers' compensation Wage costs related to time lost through work stoppage Administrative time spent by supervisors following an injury No formal employee, contractor, visitor, or temporary worker safety training program Lost productivity related to new employee learning curves and accommodation of injured employees No risk assessments on equipment and work areas High replacement costs for damaged material, machinery, or property For reference, below are OSHA's most cited violations for 2024 (in order of total number of violations), which\u00a0touches just about every corner of the manufacturing floor. Has your facility experienced injuries or near misses in any of these areas? Have preventive measures been taken to ensure it is no longer a hazard? Fall Protection - General Requirements (1926.501): 4,932 Ladders (1926.1053): 2,210 Hazard Communication (1910.1200): 1,929 Lockout/Tagout (1910.147): 1,927 Respiratory Protection (1910.134): 1,746 Scaffolding (1926.451): 1,736 Personal Protective and Lifesaving Equipment \u2013 Eye and Face Protection (1926.102): 1,524 Powered Industrial Trucks (1910.178): 1,488 Fall Protection \u2013 Training Requirements (1926.503): 1,301 Machine Guarding (1910.212): 1,295 OSHA's Focus Areas OSHA will shift focus from time to time based on season, increase in incidents in a specific industry, and programs specifically designed to decrease workplace fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. Currently, OSHA\u2019s focus areas include: Workplace violence Fall hazards Heat stress and illness prevention Whistleblower protection Hazard communication Construction-specific hazards Training and outreach Safety and Health Programs DO Work OSHA cites several proven benefits of implementing and building a culture of safety: Reducing injuries, illnesses, and deaths Lowering workers\u2019 compensation and other costs Improving morale and communication Enhancing corporate image and reputation As a result, this all translates to better processes, products, and services. Continuous Improvement The start of a safety program often leads to major improvements, but after a period of time, progress can stall. Incentives, continuing evaluations, committee changes, and consistent reinforcement from leadership will ensure a facility is committed to a culture of safety. Publicizing results will help sustain efforts and motivate employees. Recognizing and rewarding safety performance shows employees that acting on safety procedures will lead to good results. You can also foster accountability by charging costs back to the unit that incurs them for example. When individuals can be rewarded or penalized for safety measures, they will be much more willing to confront unsafe behaviors or conditions and address them or even shut them down until corrective measures are taken.

A sample list might look as follows: Provide workers with a safe work environment. Demonstrate that work is never so urgent that we cannot take time to do it safely. Demonstrate alignment with the safety mission in both words and actions. Ensure accountability at all levels of supervision for safety performance. Provide on-going property conservation practices. Provide personal protective equipment. Develop and implement safe work procedures and rules. Encourage raising concerns about hazards by everyone. Provide ongoing safety training. Conduct routine/regular workplace inspections. Enforce safety rules and appropriate discipline. Include safety as a performance measurement for all employees. To build a\u00a0safety program,\u00a0we recommend focusing on the three supporting areas of prevention, capability, and compliance . Prevention gives insight into setting a prevention goal that can be achieved based on basic safety changes, procedural changes, and more in-depth habits and technologies. Implementing easy to follow policies and hazard prevention are key concepts. Capability usually proves to be the biggest surprise for representatives as they gain an understanding of passive awareness, proactive engagement, and skill-driven engagement. Culture change starts with orientation and continues with formal and informal training opportunities and employee-driven awards that focus on catching someone in the act of \u201cdoing something right\u201d rather than the \u201cnumber of accident-free days.\u201d Compliance focuses on benchmarking and leveraging internal and external best practices, providing easy access to safety requirements, and having simple auditing and tracking methods in place. Getting Employees Involved The biggest hurdle in starting a culture of safety is getting everyone to buy-in to the idea that safety is an investment with real bottom-line benefits. Myths, stories, attitudes, norms, assumptions, and beliefs all stand in the way of getting the acceptance facilities need to develop a culture of safety. Signs, billboards, reports, and incentives can help, but in the end, the people who run the business will be your greatest asset if they know how to ensure each other\u2019s safety. Safety systems can be as simple as including safety conversations in existing meetings and a comment box, but no safety system will be successful without universal buy-in. Safety brings organizations together because everyone can work toward a common goal and improve a business\u2019 bottom line. To successfully improve a facility\u2019s safety record, there needs to be support from leadership, shared responsibilities, clear communication, and continuous improvement. Everyone must take responsibility, but the trend starts with management. If leaders don\u2019t demonstrate an active commitment to safety, nobody will. Supporting Change for a Culture of Safety To get through the initial barriers, personnel should understand why they are being asked to change what they normally do and to trust their leadership to follow through with support. Employees need to know that if they take action or speak up, they will be rewarded, not punished. There needs to be consistent support and positive reinforcement from leadership. Safety should be part of the operational fabric of a facility. That means doing things like discussing safety at the start of meetings and holding leaders accountable for safety performance. Additionally, these measures might break down organizational barriers such as fear and lack of trust. Employees should still use the chain of command, but they shouldn\u2019t have to face repercussions for speaking up. Supervisors and managers should be held accountable for their responsiveness when issues are raised. Communicating Safety Changing organizational behavior is the goal of creating a culture of safety. The continued success of a safety program hinges upon everyone\u2019s ability to clearly communicate their thoughts and intentions and act accordingly. Clear and constructive safety communication improves understanding, prevents at-risk behaviors, and enhances safe work practices. A Plan to Act can provide the procedures personnel should follow when they encounter an unsafe scenario. A safety committee that includes production teams, managers, and supervisors who can ensure responsibilities are distributed among everyone should also be established. The safety committee promotes safety awareness and reduces the potential for injury/loss at all levels of the company. The committees hold individuals accountable for meeting the goals outlined in safety reports. Leadership\u2019s directives, guidance, and training should show the committee what the right decisions are and how to make the right decision when individuals recognize an unsafe scenario. Leadership is also responsible for safety committee oversight. Formalizing a Safety Plan As mentioned, a safety program should start with a of all equipment in the facility, using a standardized method and data capture tool to ensure all machines receive the same review and that no item is left unchecked. Safety goals should be clearly defined within safety reports that are substantiated with accurate data. Overemphasis on bottom line performance, such as the accident rate, can drive accident reporting under the table. However, reporting minor incidents and near misses is important and will require additional training, attention, and time for input. With more in-depth, accurate reporting, incident rates will appear to rise initially, but it will level off and decline as safety system changes take hold. Accuracy in reporting is important because OSHA violations can carry serious consequences. According to the NSC, \"Establishing safety as a value rather than a priority tells our employees and our customers that safety is built into our culture, not something we do to merely comply with regulations.\" What this means for manufacturers is that OSHA will show up unannounced and conduct a comprehensive wall-to-wall inspection of the facility in their jurisdiction. Why? This is a local enforcement strategy designed to address issues in industries that pose a particularly high risk to workers. This differs from an incident inspection where OSHA is only interested in the area involved with the reported incident or hazard reported by a worker. Many of the are focused on specific equipment such as powered industrial trucks or hazardous respiratory conditions like breathing silica dust. If OSHA Knocked on Your Door Today, Are You Ready? As an employer, you have a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for your employees, contractors, temporary workers, and visitors. A good starting point for this might be to ask, \"Are we aligned as an organization for safety standards, communications, and training?\" If the answer is not 100 percent \u201cyes.\u201d then there is an opportunity to make a commitment to safety at the highest level of the company. Below are some of the signs that an operation may not be in compliance: Lack of continuous emphasis on safety Wages paid to injured workers for absences not covered by workers' compensation Wage costs related to time lost through work stoppage Administrative time spent by supervisors following an injury No formal employee, contractor, visitor, or temporary worker safety training program Lost productivity related to new employee learning curves and accommodation of injured employees No risk assessments on equipment and work areas High replacement costs for damaged material, machinery, or property For reference, below are OSHA's most cited violations for 2024 (in order of total number of violations), which\u00a0touches just about every corner of the manufacturing floor. Has your facility experienced injuries or near misses in any of these areas? Have preventive measures been taken to ensure it is no longer a hazard? Fall Protection - General Requirements (1926.501): 4,932 Ladders (1926.1053): 2,210 Hazard Communication (1910.1200): 1,929 Lockout/Tagout (1910.147): 1,927 Respiratory Protection (1910.134): 1,746 Scaffolding (1926.451): 1,736 Personal Protective and Lifesaving Equipment \u2013 Eye and Face Protection (1926.102): 1,524 Powered Industrial Trucks (1910.178): 1,488 Fall Protection \u2013 Training Requirements (1926.503): 1,301 Machine Guarding (1910.212): 1,295 OSHA's Focus Areas OSHA will shift focus from time to time based on season, increase in incidents in a specific industry, and programs specifically designed to decrease workplace fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. Currently, OSHA\u2019s focus areas include: Workplace violence Fall hazards Heat stress and illness prevention Whistleblower protection Hazard communication Construction-specific hazards Training and outreach Safety and Health Programs DO Work OSHA cites several proven benefits of implementing and building a culture of safety: Reducing injuries, illnesses, and deaths Lowering workers\u2019 compensation and other costs Improving morale and communication Enhancing corporate image and reputation As a result, this all translates to better processes, products, and services. Continuous Improvement The start of a safety program often leads to major improvements, but after a period of time, progress can stall. Incentives, continuing evaluations, committee changes, and consistent reinforcement from leadership will ensure a facility is committed to a culture of safety. Publicizing results will help sustain efforts and motivate employees. Recognizing and rewarding safety performance shows employees that acting on safety procedures will lead to good results. You can also foster accountability by charging costs back to the unit that incurs them for example. When individuals can be rewarded or penalized for safety measures, they will be much more willing to confront unsafe behaviors or conditions and address them or even shut them down until corrective measures are taken.

Data from studies of the behaviour of workers in three with a high focus on safety were examined in order to explore this argument. By means of data collected through a questionnaire, safe behaviour and emergency preparedness behaviour at home and during leisure time were measured in a case-control study. The findings indicate that workers in two of the three studies did not transfer safe behaviour from workplaces with a high focus on safety to home and leisure arenas. The safety consciousness acquired by workers at their workplaces in the absence of specially designed home and leisure time intervention projects seems to be insufficiently comprehensive or deep enough to influence safe behaviour in other arenas. While safe behaviour was not transferred, the emergency preparedness behaviour was. This indicates that the contextual and situational aspects of emergency preparedness are shared across risk arenas. Introduction The 1980s represented a shift in focus in safety science theory and practice from technical and human factors to management and organisational aspects of safety promotion (Hale and Hovden, 1998). These changes were partly driven by lessons learned from major disasters and approaches to regulation, and partly by an international \u201crevival\u201d in industry of an integrated strategy of goals and means to achieve general loss prevention and business success through the prevention of occupational accidents. This \u201crevival\u201d was to a large extent based on the dogma of DuPont, which maintained beliefs such as \u201call injuries can be prevented; safety must be equal to quality, costs, and productivity; safety is a line organization responsibility; good safety is good business\u201d (Webber, 1987, p.1). A central argument for the focus on Lost Time Injury (LTI) rates, near misses, and deviations was the triangle for ratios between minor, major, and fatal injuries in the \u201ciceberg theory\u201d (Heinrich, 1931, Bird and Germain, 1996, Hale, 2000). For a review, see Hale (2000). Emerging trends included arguments for more holistic approaches to safety, health, environment, and quality management in industry that were extended to include safety in traffic, home, and during leisure time in the same framework. Beliefs evolved that synergy effects, experiences, and practices regarding attitudes and behaviour could successfully transfer from one risk arena to another. The safety promotion programmes that were implemented successfully reduced the occupational accidents and injuries in many companies to a very low level (Kjell\u00e9n et al., 1997). Some ambitious companies then began to turn their attention to the safety of their employees and their families outside the workplace. Some big international companies as well as the companies studied in this article argued that safety programmes at work also influenced behaviour outside the workplace. These efforts by industry to achieve \u201c24 hours safety\u201d corresponded with initiatives from health authorities to promote and implement concepts such as \u201cSafe communities\u201d (Lund and Svanstr\u00f6m, 1995). We were interested in exploring these beliefs about behavioural transfer from occupational safety to other arenas because we had not seen empirical evidence of similarities in behaviours across different arenas. Data from three surveys were examined. Hypotheses for testing: we assume that efficient safety programmes, for example, education and training, propaganda, strict control regimes, legislation, and regulation at the workplace will affect not only safe behaviour at the workplace, but also safe behaviour in other arenas. As safety at work is normally directed towards both safe behaviour and emergency preparedness behaviour, we will separately test the influence of programmes on each of these behaviours. Generally, emergency preparedness behaviour is based more on practical training and exercises, whereas measures for safe behaviour represent a mixture of organisational and physical strategies directed towards the individual. The measures directed towards the individual are safety related job education and training, attitude influencing measures (campaigns), and behavioural modification measures. The H 1 hypothesis above expresses common beliefs. A H 0 hypothesis, i.e. there is no transfer of safe behaviours between arenas, is more challenging and interesting from a safety science point of view, because it contradicts mainstream thinking. Our data are based on three independent surveys of self-reported behaviour in groups of employees heavily exposed to occupational safety and emergency preparedness propaganda. These groups were compared with employees not specially exposed to safety measures at work. Two of the surveys were MSc theses, giving us second-hand analysis of the material without possibilities of exploring interactions with contingency factors such as gender beyond the analyses of the original reports (Bogen and Holmaas, 1994, Hoilund, 1995). Nevertheless, we found that the results from these MSc theses could be of interest to the safety science community both in terms of sources of hypotheses testing results that appear to conflict with common beliefs, and as an explorative basis for further and more sophisticated research on the transfer of behaviour between risk arenas. The hypotheses fit into a model on accident prevention developed by Lund and Aar\u00f8 (submitted for publication), which places emphasis on human, structural and cultural factors (Fig.\u00a01). This model is proposed as a supplement to the KAP-model: Knowledge\u2192Attitude\u2192Practice (Behaviour) due to reviews of research on attitude changing interventions, giving conclusions which are rather pessimistic (Wilde, 1993, OECD, 1994, Aaro and Rise, 1996). Changing of attitudes and behaviours seems to follow a more complex pathway than in the simple KAP-model. Behavioural and structural modifications might also influence workers' attitudes and beliefs towards safety. Social norms and cultural factors regarding safety will be influenced, which in turn might change the safety climate (safety culture) in a particular setting. According to the H1 hypothesis, these influences will also improve the behaviour of the worker at home and during leisure time, resulting in generally safer behaviour. From the theoretical perspectives of social and cognitive psychology (Ross and Nisbett, 1991, Kimball and Holyoak, 2000), similarities between the situational contexts of work and behaviour outside the workplace may be crucial for the success of knowledge and behavioural transfer between the arenas. Section snippets Material and methods This article is based on three similar, but independent studies of safe behaviour and emergency preparedness behaviour in the home and during leisure time among groups of employees. Workers were studied in three Norwegian industries: oil-producing platforms in the North Sea (Bogen and Holmaas, 1994), an oil refinery (H\u00f8ilund, 1995), and a smelting plant (Lund, 2000). All of these industrial settings have potential for catastrophe. They have extensive safety systems and have worked with Quality of data In Table\u00a03 the response rates and characteristics of the respondents in the case and control groups are given. The response rate varies between 77 and 41%. The response rates of the control groups in the first two studies were rather low (42 and 41%). However, we have no indication of systematic biased response patterns. The main reason for the non-responses was lack of possibilities for follow-up of those receiving the questionnaire compared with the third study. Men dominated the case groups Safe behaviour in home and during leisure time among workers Table\u00a01 provides responses to the questions regarding safe behaviour for the three studies. The mean value of workers' responses to the different questions on safe behaviour seems rather similar in case and control groups, both between case and control groups, and between the studies. The similarities and differences among the three studies are more visible when the safe behaviour indexes are calculated. The distributions of the safe behaviour index values for the case and control groups in the Discussion While the safety programmes conducted in the working environment of the offshore oil installations and the oil refinery seem to have had little effect on the safe behaviour in other arenas of the workers' lives, there is an effect on the emergency preparedness behaviour. The significant safer behaviour at home and during leisure time found for the male workers at the smelting plant might be explained by the intervention project conducted during the preceding 2 years. One of the main aims of Conclusions and implications for prevention The findings in this study indicate that workers in two of the three studies did not transfer safe behaviour from workplaces with high focus on safety to home and leisure arenas. The transferral of safe behaviour among the men in the smelting plant study might be explained by their exposure to the specially designed intervention programme at the plant aimed at increasing safe behaviour at home and during leisure time activities. The main aim of that project was to improve the safety behaviour Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge with gratitude the contributions from Live Bogen, Eldbj\u00f8rg Holmaas, and Richard H\u00f8ilund.

It is no means an exhaustive list, and as always, vigilance and awareness of your surroundings is your best defense. PERSONAL SAFETY TIPS: SOCIAL MEDIA AWARENESS: Be aware of what you post on the Internet, you never know who is looking at your information. It could be stalkers, future employers, recruiters, family, etc. Consider locking down access to your social media platforms to only close family and friends, as open pages can be used to gather a lot of personal information on you, your life patterns or that of family or friends. If you need those platforms for work, keep a separate personal one that is more secure for your personal business, and keep the work ones focused in that realm. HOME SAFETY: Consider installing a home camera/alarm system with DVR/Cloud recorded cameras. Include a doorbell with video & sound capability so you can observe who is there and speak with them without opening your door. Deadbolts with long throws and extra-long screws that make it well into the door jamb/framing, should be on any exterior entry door. Glass slider type doors should have wood dowels in the slider tracks or frame locks that prevent the slider from being lifted off the rails to gain entry. Protective window films can be applied to doors and windows if you feel the need for additional security or have a particularly vulnerable window or door. Foliage around windows, and entry doors should be trimmed, so you can view those areas easily from inside the home, and so that it does not provide criminals an easy place to hide from view.

PREAMBLE 1.1 The Constitution of India provide detailed provisions for the rights of the citizens and also lays down the Directive Principles of State Policy which set an aim to which the activities of the state are to be guided. 1.2 These Directive Principles provide (a) for securing the health and strength of employees, men and women; b) that the tender age of children are not abused; c) that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength; d) just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief are provided; and e) that the Government shall take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure the participation of employee in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry. 1.3 On the basis of these Directive Principles as well as international instruments, Government is committed to regulate all economic activities for management of safety and health risks at workplaces and to provide measures so as to ensure safe and healthy working conditions for every working man and woman in the nation. Government recognizes that safety and health of workers has a positive impact on productivity and economic and social development. Prevention is an integral part of economic activities as high safety and health standard at work is as important as good business performance for new as well as existing industries. 1.4 The formulation of policy, priorities and strategies in occupational safety, health and environment at work places, is undertaken by national authorities in consultation with social partners for fulfilling such objectives. A critical role is played by the Government and the social partners, professional safety and health organizations in ensuring prevention and in also providing treatment, support and rehabilitation services. 1.5 Government of India firmly believes that without safe, clean environment as well as healthy working conditions, social justice and economic growth cannot be achieved and that safe and healthy working environment is recognized as a fundamental human right. Education, training, consultation and exchange of information and good practices are essential for prevention and promotion of such measures. 1.6 The changing job patterns and working relationships, the rise in self employment, greater sub-contracting, outsourcing of work, homework and the increasing number of employees working away from their establishment, pose problems to management of occupational safety and health risks at workplaces. New safety hazards and health risks will be appearing along with the transfer and adoption of new technologies. In addition, many of the well known conventional hazards will continue to be present at the workplace till the risks arising from exposure to these hazards are brought under adequate control. While advancements in technology have minimized or eliminated some hazards at workplace, new risks can emerge in their place which needs to be addressed. 1.7 Particular attention needs to be paid to the hazardous operations and of employees in risk prone conditions such as migrant employees and various vulnerable groups of employees arising out of greater mobility in the workforce with more people working for a number of employers, either consecutively or simultaneously. 1.8 The increasing use of chemicals, exposure to physical, chemical and biological agents with hazard potential unknown to people; the indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals including pesticides, agricultural machineries and equipment; industries with major accident risks; effects of computer controlled technologies and alarming influence of stress at work in many modern jobs pose serious safety, health and environmental risks. .9 The fundamental purpose of this National Policy on Safety, Health and Environment at workplace, is not only to eliminate the incidence of work related injuries, diseases, fatalities, disaster and loss of national assets and ensuring achievement of a high level of occupational safety, health and environment performance through proactive approaches but also to enhance the well-being of the employee and society, at large. The necessary changes in this area will be based on a co-ordinated national effort focused on clear national goals and objectives. 1.10 Every Ministry or Department may work out their detailed policy relevant to their working environment as per the guidelines on the National Policy. 2.

PREAMBLE 1.1 The Constitution of India provide  detailed provisions for the rights of the citizens and also lays down the Directive Principles of State Policy which set an aim to which the activities of the state are to be guided. 1.2 These Directive Principles provide (a) for securing the health and strength of employees, men and women; b) that the tender age of children are not abused; c) that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength; d) just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief are provided; and e) that the Government shall take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure the participation of employee in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry. 1.3 On the basis of these Directive Principles as well as international instruments, Government is committed to regulate all economic activities for management of safety and health risks at workplaces and to provide measures so as to ensure safe and healthy working conditions for every working man and woman in the nation. Government recognizes that safety and health of workers has a positive impact on productivity and economic and social development.

        "markdown": "Select Your Style Choose your layout Patterns for Boxed Layout Color scheme What Are Civil Rights The following are some of the important civil rights. Right of Life It is the most fundamental of all civil rights. Man must live first before he can do anything. The State must make adequate provision for the personal safety of its citizens. This right also implies the right to self-defense and prevention of suicide. Right to Liberty This right implies free movement. Every citizen has complete freedom to move within the State. None can be detained arbitrarily without trial and there must be provision for redress of wrongful arrest: In India if anybody is arrested by the government, he must be ordinarily put before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest. Right to Property Property in democracy is regarded as a sacred institution. It creates a sense of possession and an incentive to work. It is reward for one's ability and is essential for the good of man and society. Machiavelli once said, \"Man may forget the murder of his father but he will never forget the loss of his property\". The communists, of course, advocate the abolition of property. However, all democratic States guarantee this right to their citizens. Right to Contract The right to contract means that every citizen can live, work, earn and freely contract on the basis of equality with other citizens. Contract is a mutual agreement between two or more parties imposing some obligations on each other. This contract is the essential basis of society. Right to Freedom of Speech Right to freedom of speech is a primary necessity of man. There can be no society unless its members are free to express their opinion and exchange their views without restraints. The citizens have, therefore, the right to freely criticize the policies and actions of authorities. Freedom of Press The right to freedom of press is closely associated with right to freedom speech. It means the right to publish what a man can lawfully speak. Opinion of the citizens can be published in newspaper and pamphlets. Newspapers are the most powerful organ in modern democracy to mould public opinion. Free discussions and criticisms are essential for the success of democracy. Right to Form Association Man lives in group and forms associations. He has different aspects of life and each aspect may be represented in an association. This is what is called the \"split\" personality of man. The State is regarded as a political association. However, it is not the only association in the society. There are other associations like cultural, educational, philanthropic and religious associations in a society. Men have right to form associations. Right to Religion and Conscience Religion is deeply rooted in the nature of man. An individual should be free to follow any religion he likes. He should have complete liberty of belief and worship. The State has nothing to do with the religions of citizens. Many of the modern States are, therefore, secular States. Right to Culture and Language Every citizen will follow and develop his own culture and language. The minorities in a democracy should be allowed to protect their rights and privileges. In the Indian Constitution, there is provision for educational and cultural rights. A citizen in India is allowed to preserve his language, script and culture. He is also free to be admitted in any educational institution situated in the country. Right to Equality It means the absence of legal discrimination against any individual, group, class or race. All should be equal in the eyes of law and all\u00a0should get equal protection of law. The State should not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, language, caste or sex. Right to Equality is a fundamental right in the Indian Constitution. Right to Family The last but not the least, is the right to family. The family system brings some social virtues in man. Family is often called the \"cradle of civic virtues\". The right to family is therefore, one of the elementary rights and it provides for the fight to marriage, the right to maintain the purity of such marriage, the right to custody and control of children and the right of inheritance. These are some of the important civil rights of a citizen in a modern State. These rights are not absolute. They can be restricted for the interest of the State. Even the rights to life, liberty and property are restricted by the state during war and emergency. During the time of war and emergency, it is the duty of all citizens to protect and uphold the sovereignty of the State, even if they have to sacrifice their lives.

The State should not \n\ndiscriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, language, caste or sex. Right to Equality \n\nis a fundamental right in the Indian Constitution. Right to Family The last but not the least, is the right to family. The family system brings some social virtues in man. \n\nFamily is often called the \"cradle of civic virtues\". The right to family is therefore, one of the \n\nelementary rights and it provides for the fight to marriage, the right to maintain the purity of such \n\nmarriage, the right to custody and control of children and the right of inheritance. These are some of the important civil rights of a citizen in a modern State. These rights are not \n\nabsolute. They can be restricted for the interest of the State. Even the rights to life, liberty and \n\nproperty are restricted by the state during war and emergency. During the time of war and \n\nemergency, it is the duty of all citizens to protect and uphold the sovereignty of the State, even if they \n\nhave to sacrifice their lives.

        "markdown": "CRIMINAL LAW & YOUR RIGHTS MARCH 2008 What are your rights? As a human being and as a citizen you automatically have certain rights. These rights are not a gift from anyone, including the state. In fact, the state must protect your rights. For example, the right to be free from torture means that no state agents are allowed to torture you. Further, the state must do all it can to prevent torture and to punish those guilty of torture. The most important rights are often called basic rights. In Sudan, these rights are listed in the Bill of Rights of the National Interim Constitution. The Constitution is the highest law in Sudan. It was adopted in 2005. The Constitution says that \u201cWe, the People of Sudan, are committed \u2026to uphold values of justice, equality, human dignity and equal rights and duties of men and women.\u201d The Bill of Rights makes international human rights part of Sudanese law. These are the rights recognised by states around the world. Sudan has ratified some of the most important international human rights treaties like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. This means that the state has agreed to respect these rights and to apply them in Sudan. The basic rights listed in the Bill of Rights include: The right to life. It is one of the most important rights and is fundamental to all other rights. The right to liberty and security. It is understandable that persons who are suspects or have been convicted of serious crimes may have to be arrested and imprisoned. But there is always a real danger of abuse, because people who are arrested or detained may be completely innocent and there may be no justifiable reason to take away their freedom. There are many rights that protect you from such arbitrary arrest and detention. For example, in any case where the police want to arrest you, you should be informed of the reasons and you should be given the right to see a lawyer. The right to fair trial. This means that anyone who is a suspect or an accused must be allowed to defend him or herself. If you become a suspect or an accused, you have the right to be presumed innocent. Being accused of a crime doesn\u2019t mean that you are guilty; it is just an accusation. The police and prosecutors must prove that you have actually committed the crime and are guilty. You also have the right to a lawyer which is very important so that you can defend yourself and there is less risk of abuse of power. All trials should be public and fair. There is a saying that it is \"better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.\" Prohibition of slavery and forced labour, and the prohibition of torture. It is widely recognised that the whole international family bears some guilt for allowing slavery to have taken place. The same attitude of shame should apply to torture. Torture is one of the worst experiences that anyone can suffer; it often leaves permanent physical and psychological scars. There can never be any excuse for torture, not even trying to prevent or solve the most horrible crime because torture violates fundamental human dignity. Whatever you have done, the authorities should never beat you or inflict pain to force you to do something or for any other reasons. Freedom of expression, assembly and association. These are important rights. They allow you to speak freely, to meet up with others, and to form groups and organisations, as long as you are not doing harm to the rights of others or disturbing public safety as determined by law. Other rights include: the right to respect private and family life, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. All these rights are constitutional rights. The Constitution is called \u201cthe father of laws\u201d which means that the Constitution is supreme and higher than ordinary laws. All laws should follow the Constitution and should be compatible with constitutional rights. For example, the Bill of Rights says that you have the right to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. However, if you are a victim of torture, the ordinary laws do not say that those responsible for all forms of torture should be prosecuted and punished, and that you have the right to obtain compensation and justice. This is a weakness with the ordinary laws, as they should clearly protect your rights; anyone who violates the rights should be prosecuted, tried, and, if guilty, punished. What is the law? The law is a set of rules that have been developed to make sure that citizens and others know what their rights and responsibilities are. Laws are made by parliament and are applied by the authorities, such as the police or general prosecution. The courts should interpret the law and rule on any disputes or accusations. The highest court in Sudan is the Constitutional Court. All persons in Sudan have the right to bring a case to the courts and judges should be independent in doing their work. Why does criminal law matter? Criminal law deals with crimes and punishments. Most of the crimes are defined in what is called the Penal Code. This Code contains the definitions of the acts which constitute crimes and the punishments for committing them. It also determines the rules of criminal liability. But there are other laws which also contain crimes and punishments: pharmaceutical laws, for example, criminalise certain acts connected to selling medical drugs. Most of the basic rights should be protected by criminal laws. There should be definite crimes to punish those who violate these rights, and this will act as a deterrent against these violations. Accusing persons of committing crimes is a serious matter. You cannot be sure of the guilt of the suspect or the accused persons. History shows that many people were wrongfully accused, convicted and punished. Criminal justice rules must ensure that this does not happen and that individuals can defend themselves properly. Punishments can be harsh and disproportionate to the crime. A good example can be found in a famous $19^{\\mathrm{th}}$ century\u2019s French novel titled \u201cLes Miserables\u201d by Victor Hugo, in which a man was treated like a dangerous criminal and was imprisoned for stealing a peace of bread to feed his hunger. There are numerous laws in Sudan that provide for harsh punishments. On the other hand, criminal laws sometimes fail to protect society from certain crimes. For example, under Sudanese laws it is almost impossible to prove the crime of rape because four male eyewitnesses are needed. The law does not protect girls and women against sexual violence. Criminal laws should always maintain the balance between the right of individuals and society to be protected from crimes and the rights of accused persons to be treated in a lawful way. Convicted criminals should be punished in ways that are proportionate to the crimes, and the punishments should not be cruel, inhumane or degrading. How does criminal law affect you? As a private citizen and as an ordinary person you may ask why you should be bothered about criminal law. You may think that there are people who should be tasked to deal with these matters and that they would have the powers and expertise to deal with it. After all, you are a law-abiding citizen and there is nothing to make you worry about these things. Nevertheless, there is always a possibility that you or any person you care about might be accused of having committed a crime. It has happened to all sorts of people, and it is more likely to happen where the laws are weak, unclear or unfair that the result can be wrong convictions and unfair punishments. Conversely, you or a person you care for could be the victim of crime. Either way, there is a reason for you to be concerned about criminal justice. The rate of crime and the degree of safety affect all aspects of life. It also affects the economic prosperity of the society which benefits from the rule of law. Can criminal laws be defective? Laws have to be carefully phrased because they determine the rights and the status of individuals; they also affect the liberty and safety of human beings. Badly drafted law can result in a loss of rights and can have a harmful impact on the liberty and safety of individuals. Laws that fail to put the right balance between protecting society from crime on the one hand and the liberty of individuals on the other are flawed. Prevention of crime and respect for the rights of accused can and should go hand in hand. Defective criminal laws are generally those laws which contribute to violations of human rights. These laws may fail to provide adequate protection against the violations and/or may result in a lack of punishment for those guilty. An example is the immunity given to members of the police and security forces. Everyone should be equal before the law. Law enforcement agencies and personnel should abide by the law. Where they are accused of a crime, they should benefit from all rights to defend themselves and to have a fair trial. The failure of the Penal Code to provide protection for rape victims is another example. The required proof of four male eye-witnesses to the actual act makes it impossible to convict anyone of rape. In one case, a man who had raped a little girl could not be convicted for rape and received only minor punishment even though there were several witnesses and medical evidence to prove his guilt. How to make your rights a reality? In order to make your rights a reality you have to know your rights and know how to claim those rights. In Sudan your rights are listed in the Bill of Rights of the National Interim Constitution. The Bill of Rights dictates that rights enshrined in the international treaties ratified by Sudan are part and parcel of your rights. There has never been a better definition of rights in any of the previous Sudanese constitutions. Nevertheless, many laws in Sudan do not grant or contradict the basic rights found in the Bill of Rights. The first step therefore is to change these laws so that they reflect the rights and guarantee the protection of those rights. The Government has set up committees and a few laws have been reformed However, more needs to be done to ensure that criminal laws respect your rights. There is a need for a serious and vigorous campaign to implement the needed changes through law reform. \u2022 Your active contribution in the campaign for law reform is a practical way to assert you rights. You can talk to family members, friends, community representatives, officials and the media. You can also talk to lawyers and human rights organisations and tell them what should be done so that your rights are respected and protected. Your voice matters and the more people say publicly how the laws should protect and not violate their rights, the more likely it is that their views will be taken seriously. Together we can make Sudan a better place for us and future generations.",

It is a set of conducts that is established and enforced by a sovereign authority to ensure and maintain orderly coexistence in the society\u00a0[ ]\u00a0. Law refers to a \u201ccommand proceeding from the supreme political authority of a state and addressed to the persons who are subject to that authority\u201d\u00a0[ ]\u00a0. Law helps the society, citizens and civilization to cohabit peacefully by providing them with a guideline about how to behave, how to act in social and business life, how to arbitrate the conflicts between multiples parties. Rule of law is a general legal maxim\u00a0[ ]\u00a0according to which decisions should be made by applying known principles or laws, without the intervention of discretion in their application.\u00a0[ ]\u00a0This maxim is intended to be a safeguard against arbitrary governance. The word \u201carbitrary\u201d signifies a judgment made at the discretion of the arbiter, rather than according to the rule of law.\u00a0[ ] Albert Venn Dicey\u2019s theory on the Rule of Law In discussing the rule of law, the views of Albert Venn Dicey put forth in his \u201cIntroduction to the Law of the Constitution\u201d, are indispensable. To him the main components of rule of law are: No punishment may be inflicted other than for a breach of the law. Irrespective of rank and status all are equal under the law. Rights and freedoms are best protected under the common law. Rule of Law prevents the authority to use their power arbitrarily, and provides protection for the citizens: Authority must not use their power arbitrarily: Equality before law and avoidance of arbitrary use of power can be two important areas where the authority must decide wisely on how to enforce the law. Equality before law: Equality before law means every citizen in a given area will be treated equally before the law and there will be no discrimination or privileges to any particular group or individual. Without this fundamental characteristic, any law can lose its effectiveness drastically. If two different persons are treated two different ways just because of their social background then we could say it as a breach of equality before law and that would propel instability and violence in the society. Marxism\u00a0[ ]\u00a0doubts that law represents the interest of the powerful within the society in modern world. International Bar Association combined the concept of equality of law with rule of law and said, \u201cThe Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilized society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all\u201d.\u00a0[ ] In some cases we see that even the constitution might have conflicting position about ensuring the equality before law. For example, Bangladesh Constitution is said to guarantee the equality before to all its citizens.\u00a0[ ]\u00a0But at the same time, it gives the parliament the authority to provide indemnity to any state officer, which might possibly sometimes breach the equality before law\u00a0[ ]\u00a0, because all citizens are not treated equally. Avoidance of arbitrary use of power: An authority or government must not use their power arbitrarily. Sometimes certain laws allow them to practice some degree of arbitrary power over citizens, but that power is used unwisely, then it might become contradictory with the higher laws and constitution and promote injustice in the civil society. For Example, In Bangladesh, section 54 of the Criminal Code gives the power to police to arrest an individual without the order from a magistrate and without warrant just on the basis on suspicion.\u00a0[ ]\u00a0This is frequently used by Bangladesh Police force to pry information out of individuals after arresting them with arbitrary power. Dhaka Metropolitan Police often use another similar law which allows them to arrest any individual after dark whoever fails to provide any satisfactory explanation.\u00a0[ ] Professor David H. Balyey said, \u201cIn India today, a dual system of criminal justice has grown up, the one of the law and the other of politics. With respect at least to the police, decisions made by the police officials, about the application of law, are frequently subject to partisan review or direction by the elected representatives.\u201d\u00a0[ ] If these options are used randomly and on a regular basis without any knowledge of long-term impact, then it might pose a serious dissatisfaction among the public and cause instability in the legal environment. So government officials will have to decide wisely when and where to use them. Here again, the supreme power of constitution provides shelter to the citizens if they fall victim to any governmental arbitration. Bangladesh constitution safeguards against arrest and detention. It says, \u201cEvery person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest, excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate, and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.\u201d\u00a0[ ] USA PATRIOT Act\u00a0[ ]\u00a0is a recent example of arbitrary power practice by the government. This law was enacted by US Government on October 26, 2001 mainly to fight terrorism but it denied appreciating one of the fundamental characteristic of US Constitution which is freedom of expression and privacy of citizens. This law gave the authority the power to search and spy on any form of communication in the country, detaining any foreign citizens without court order if they are thought suspicious. This sparked a lot of criticisms throughout the country, and provoked a lot of violence in the society. Here, the US government failed to uphold the rights of citizens. Judicial Activism: A Possible protection against discretionary power: In case of vulnerability of existing law, the Judicial Activism\u00a0[ ]\u00a0can be a very timely solution for any country to protect the citizens from crime and discretionary power practice by the higher authority. Especially The High Court of Australia gives immense importance about judicial review of their existing laws.\u00a0[ ]\u00a0Australian legal practices assure that there must be some minimum capacities of judicial review of administrative section\u00a0[ ]\u00a0and the courts have a duty to exercise a jurisdiction which is regularly invoked\u00a0[ ]\u00a0. The importance of judicial review is, as stated by Brian Z. Tamanaha, \u201cThroughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices.\u201d\u00a0[ ] Absence of appropriate law acts as an obstacle to prevent crime: In many cases, it is seen that a country does not always have appropriate laws against all types of crime. Therefore, those crimes happen with very much ease. For example, software piracy is an internationally recognized crime, but in Bangladesh there is no solid law to prevent this. That\u2019s why Bangladesh is at the top of software piracy in Asia Pacific\u00a0[ ]\u00a0where software vendors lose 102 million US dollars every year\u00a0[ ]\u00a0due to this crime, but no laws or government authority take any actions because of the absence of proper law. Rule of law and Protection from Crime: Thousands of years ago ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle coined the importance of law by stating\u00a0[ ]\u00a0that \u201claw should govern\u201d, and the higher authority who are responsible for the implementation of law should be \u201cservants of the laws.\u201d According to another famous Greek philosopher Plato, law should be primary source of guidance for a country. He wrote\u00a0[ ]\u00a0, \u201cIf law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state.\u201d And there comes the importance of rule of law. Rule of law prevents government from using its power at will, and ensures that the convicts can defend themselves in front of law. The rights of individuals are determined by legal rules and not the arbitrary behavior of authorities. There can be no punishment unless a court decides there has been a breach of law. Everyone, regardless of their position in society, is subject to the law, and held equally responsible.\u00a0[ ] Therefore, Law is a formal and detailed code of conduct that shapes the economy, politics, culture and human rights in a country if it is enforced by a knowledgeable higher authority. The basic function of law is to protect the society from crime. A crime can be defined as any type of offense that goes against the civil society, for example, murder, theft, robbery, fraud, assault, copyright infringement, contract violation and so on. Crime is inevitable in any society. The possible reasons behind committing a crime are being a victim, eyeing an opportunity to gain something and absence of a proper supervisory authority. This is where law of the country comes to play its part by bringing the criminal under justice, convicting them under certain penal code depending on the nature of the crime and declare certain sentences for that particular offense. It is scientifically proved that human mind always gets influenced by its surroundings. All mental factors and actions of a human being are dynamically interrelated with social, economic, biological and psychological events happening around\u00a0[ ]\u00a0. Hence, it is a tendency of human mind and civilization to learn from past experience. Therefore, when in a society people observe a criminal being convicted and punished they learn about the undesirable consequences of committing a crime, so that in future the rate of crime in that society decreases which is better for peace in the civilization. An important thing to notice is, good legal environment always allow the convicted person to get opportunity of self defense, so that no innocent person is punished. The goal of sentence to serve in prison is to turn the bad person into a good one. Inside the prison the authority helps the prisoners to learn moral values and principles. So after coming out of the prison, they experience a changed and positive mindset toward the society, and they no longer act as a threat to the civilization and country. Protection of human rights through constitutional law: Constitution is a written document that describes the fundamental structure and procedures of a government in a given state. According to Scott Gordon, a constitution \u201ccontains institutionalized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and liberties of the citizenry, including those that may be in the minority.\u201d\u00a0[ ] Violation of human rights is prevented by strict application of constitutional law. In Bangladesh, if any citizen faces any violation of his/her fundamental human rights they are entitled to seek help from the law according to the Bangladesh constitution. It ensures the protection of law, equal rights, prohibition of forced labor, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and equal opportunity for public employment for every citizen of Bangladesh.\u00a0[ ] Another important aspect that has been clarified in Bangladesh Constitution is government cannot make any law that goes against the fundamentals of the constitution i.e., no law can be made that violate human rights or the right order in society. It says, \u201cLaws inconsistent with fundamental rights to be void\u201d\u00a0[ ] Therefore, a constitution which is the highest law of a country should give protection to its citizens from any crime and arbitrary use of power by the higher authority. Conclusion: Rule of law has its own strength for protecting human right, resolving dispute and establishing a peaceful society. It helps people to feel that there is always an invisible friendly hand who will act as a shield against the inequalities they face in their daily life. But it establishment is very much dependant on the sovereign authority of the state. If they fail to make the law equal to everyone, deprived citizen will then feel that law of their state is a tyranny for them. A government should enforce those laws which will go with the public interest, not for authorities\u2019 own illegal purpose, not against the public sentiment. Because they have to know that law has a wide array of implications in every layer of the society. Therefore, rule of law will protect the society from any kind of crime, anarchy, inequality and it will defense everyone to get their proper judgment. The authority of the state has the power to create a new constitution, a new law. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they can do as they wish. All are equal in law. Everyone has to be stood in front of law if any unlawful thing happens. So not only the public but also the government, the sovereign authority must have to obey the law and have to make the proper use of law to protect the civilization from any hazards.

        "markdown": "Print XClose Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Women and Child Development 19 JUL 2019 5:30PM by PIB Delhi Protection of Women and Child Rights As per National Crime Records Bureau which is available up to 2016, the details of State/UT-wise cases registered under crime against women and crime against children during 2014- 2016 are at Annexure-I. The Ministry recognizes that incidence of crime against women cannot be controlled unless mindsets of people, in general, are made to change. There are many reasons behind increasing crimes against women such as unequal economic, social and political status of women, patriarchal mindsets etc. \u2018Police\u2019 and \u2018Public Order\u2019 are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities towards maintenance of law and order and protection of life and property of citizens rest primarily with State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. However, safety and security of women and children in the country is of utmost priority for the Government. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been administering various special laws relating to women such as \u2018The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\u2019, \u2018The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961\u2019, \u2018The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986\u2019, \u2018The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013\u2019, and \u2018The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006\u2019. India is signatory to United Nations Convention on Right of Child (UNCRC) since 1992. In adherence to its commitment to ensure child rights, the Government has framed the National Policy for Children 2013 and National Plan of Action 2016. It has also framed Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and The Commissions for Protection of Child Right (CPCR) Act, 2005. The Juvenile Justice Act mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide Institutional or non-institutional care for children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law. The POCSO Act acknowledges various kind of child sex abuse and provides stringent punishment for the same. It provides for child friendly procedures at every stage of trial and stipulates mandatory reporting of the crime. Criminal Law (Amendment), Act 2013 was enacted for effective legal deterrence against sexual offences. Further, \u2018The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018\u2019 have also been enacted making the punishment for offences like rape more stringent by including death penalty for rape of a girl below the age of 12 years. The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 mandates right of children to free and compulsory education.

        "html": "Print X Close Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Women and Child Development 19 JUL 2019 5:30PM by PIB Delhi Protection of Women and Child Rights As per National Crime Records Bureau which is available up to 2016, the details of State/UT-wise cases registered under crime against women and crime against children during 2014- 2016 are at Annexure-I. The Ministry recognizes that incidence of crime against women cannot be controlled unless mindsets of people, in general, are made to change. There are many reasons behind increasing crimes against women such as unequal economic, social and political status of women, patriarchal mindsets etc. \u2018Police\u2019 and \u2018Public Order\u2019 are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities towards maintenance of law and order and protection of life and property of citizens rest primarily with State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. However, safety and security of women and children in the country is of utmost priority for the Government. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been administering various special laws relating to women such as \u2018The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\u2019, \u2018The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961\u2019, \u2018The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986\u2019, \u2018The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013\u2019, and \u2018The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006\u2019. India is signatory to United Nations Convention on Right of Child (UNCRC) since 1992. In adherence to its commitment to ensure child rights, the Government has framed the National Policy for Children 2013 and National Plan of Action 2016. It has also framed Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and The Commissions for Protection of Child Right (CPCR) Act, 2005. The Juvenile Justice Act mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide Institutional or non-institutional care for children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law. The POCSO Act acknowledges various kind of child sex abuse and provides stringent punishment for the same. It provides for child friendly procedures at every stage of trial and stipulates mandatory reporting of the crime. Criminal Law (Amendment), Act 2013 was enacted for effective legal deterrence against sexual offences. Further, \u2018The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018\u2019 have also been enacted making the punishment for offences like rape more stringent by including death penalty for rape of a girl below the age of 12 years. The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 mandates right of children to free and compulsory education. The CPCR Act, 2005 mandates establishment of Statutory Commissions at centre and State levels to protect, defend and promote child rights in the country. National Commission and all the State Commissions have been set up under the said Act. The Government of India has set up a non-lapsable corpus of fund under Nirbhaya Fund Framework for enhancing safety and security of women.

As per the UNESCO estimates, the number of the aged(60+) is likely to 590 million in 2005. The figure will double by 2025. By 2025, the world will have more elderly than young people and cross two billion mark by 2050. In India also, the population of elder persons has increased form nearly 2 crores in 1951 to 7.2 crores in 2001. In other words about 8% of the total population is above 60 years. The figure will cross 18 % mark by 2025. Problems of The Aged Problems of the aged as follows: Economic problems, include such problems as loss of employment, income deficiency and economic insecurity. Physical and physiological problems, include health and medical problems, nutritional deficiency, and the problem of adequate housing etc. Psycho-social problem which cover problems related with their psychological and social maladjustment as well as the problem of elder abuse etc. International Efforts The question of ageing was first debated at the United Nations in 1948 at the initiative of Argentina. The issue was again raised by Malta in 1969. In 1971 the General Assembly asked the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report on the elderly and to suggest guideline for the national and international action. In 1978, Assembly decided to hold a World Conference on the Ageing. Accordingly, the World Assembly on Ageing was held in Vienna from July 26 to August 6, 1982 wherein an International Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted. The overall goal of the Plan was to strengthen the ability of individual countries to deal effectively with the ageing in their population, keeping in mind the special concerns and needs of the elderly. The Plan attempted to promote understanding of the social, economic and cultural implications of ageing and of related humanitarian and developed issues. The International Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted by the General Assembly in 1982 and the Assembly in subsequent years called on governments to continue to implement its principles and recommendations. The Assembly urged the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to ensure that follow-up action to the Plan is carried out effectively. In 1992, the U.N.General Assembly adopted the proclamation to observe the year 1999 as he International Year of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly has declared \u201cIst October\u201d as the International Day for the Elderly, later rechristened as the International Day of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly on December 16, 1991 adopted 18 principles which are organized into 5 clusters, namely-independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment, and dignity of the older persons. These principles provide a broad framework for action on ageing. Some of the Principles are as follows Older Persons should have the opportunity to work and determine when to leave the work force. Older Persons should remain integrated in society and participate actively in the formulation of policies which effect their well-being. Older Persons should have access to health care to help them maintain the optimum level of physical, mental and emotional well-being. Older Persons should be able to pursue opportunities for the full development of their potential and have access to educational, cultural, spiritual and recreational resources of society. Older Persons should be able to live in dignity and security and should be free from exploitation and mental and physical abuse. National Efforts (I) Constitutional Protection: Art. 41 : Right to work, to education and to public assistance in certain cases : The State shall, within the limits of economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want. Art. 46 : Promotion of educational and economic interests of \u2026\u2026. and other weaker sections : The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people\u2026..and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. However, these provision are included in the Chapter IV i.e., Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution. The Directive Principles, as stated in Article 37, are not enforceable by any court of law. But Directive Principles impose positive obligations on the state, i.e., what it should do. The Directive Principles have been declared to be fundamental in the governance of the country and the state has been placed under an obligation to apply them in making laws. The courts however cannot enforce a Directive Principle as it does not create any justiciable right in favour of any individual. It is most unfortunate that state has not made even a single Act which are directly related to the elderly persons. (II) Legal Protections: Under Personal Laws: The moral duty to maintain parents is recognized by all people. However, so far as law is concerned, the position and extent of such liability varies from community to community. (I) Hindus Laws: Amongst the Hindus, the obligation of sons to maintain their aged parents, who were not able to maintain themselves out of their own earning and property, was recognized even in early texts. And this obligation was not dependent upon, or in any way qualified, by a reference to the possession of family property. It was a personal legal obligation enforceable by the sovereign or the state. The statutory provision for maintenance of parents under Hindu personal law is contained in Sec 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. This Act is the first personal law statute in India, which imposes an obligation on the children to maintain their parents. As is evident from the wording of the section, the obligation to maintain parents is not confined to sons only, and daughters also have an equal duty towards parents. It is important to note that only those parents who are financially unable to maintain themselves from any source, are entitled to seek maintenance under this Act. (II) Muslim Law: Children have a duty to maintain their aged parents even under the Muslim law. According to Mulla : (a) Children in easy circumstances are bound to maintain their poor parents, although the latter may be able to earn something for themselves. (b) A son though in strained circumstances is bound to maintain his mother, if the mother is poor, though she may not be infirm. (c) A son, who though poor, is earning something, is bound to support his father who earns nothing. According to Tyabji, parents and grandparents in indigent circumstances are entitled, under Hanafi law, to maintenance from their children and grandchildren who have the means, even if they are able to earn their livelihood. Both sons and daughters have a duty to maintain their parents under the Muslim law. The obligation, however, is dependent on their having the means to do so. (III) Christian And Parsi Law: The Christians and Parsis have no personal laws providing for maintenance for the parents. Parents who wish to seek maintenance have to apply under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. (III) Under The Code of Criminal Procedure: Prior to 1973, there was no provision for maintenance of parents under the code. The Law Commission, however, was not in favour of making such provision. According to its report: The Cr.P.C is not the proper place for such a provision. There will be considerably difficulty in the amount of maintenance awarded to parents apportioning amongst the children in a summary proceeding of this type. It is desirable to leave this matter for adjudication by civil courts. The provision, however, was introduced for the first time in Sec. 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1973. It is also essential that the parent establishes that the other party has sufficient means and has neglected or refused to maintain his, i.e., the parent, who is unable to maintain himself. It is important to note that Cr.P.C 1973, is a secular law and governs persons belonging to all religions and communities. Daughters, including married daughters, also have a duty to maintain their parents. (IV) Governmental Protections: 1. The Government of India approved the National Policy for Older Persons on January 13, 1999 in order to accelerate welfare measures and empowering the elderly in ways beneficial for them. This policy included the following major steps : Setting up of a pension fund for ensuring security for those persons who have been serving in the unorganized sector, Construction of old age homes and day care centers for every 3-4 districts, Establishment of resource centers and re-employment bureaus for people above 60 years, Concessional rail/air fares for travel within and between cities, i.e.,30% discount in train and 50% in Indian Airlines. Enacting legislation for ensuring compulsory geriatric care in all the public hospitals. 2. The Ministry of Justice and Empowerment has announced regarding the setting up of a National Council for Older Person, called agewell Foundation. It will seek opinion of aged on measures to make life easier for them. 3. Attempts to sensitise school children to live and work with the elderly. Setting up of a round the clock help line and discouraging social ostracism of the older persons are being taken up. 4. The government policy encourages a prompt settlement of pension, provident fund (PF), gratuity, etc. in order to save the superannuated persons from any hardships. It also encourages to make the taxation policies elder sensitive. 5. The policy also accords high priority to their health care needs. 6. According to Sec.88-B, 88-D and 88-DDB of Income Tax Act there are discount in tax for the elderly persons. 7. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has also been providing several scheme for the benefit of aged persons, i.e., Jeevan Dhara Yojana, Jeevan Akshay Yojana, Senior Citizen Unit Yojana, Medical Insurance Yojana. 8. Former Prime Minister A.B.Bajpai was also launch \u2018Annapurana Yojana\u2019 for the benefit of aged persons. Under this yojana unattended aged persons are being given 10 kg food for every month. 9. It is proposed to allot 10 percent of the houses constructed under government schemes for the urban and rural lower income segments to the older persons on easy loan. The policy mentions: The layout of the housing colonies will respond to the needs and life styles of the elderly so that there is no physical barriers to their mobility; they are allotted ground floor; and their social interaction with older society members exists. Despite all these attempts, there is need to impress upon the elderly about the need to adjust to the changing circumstances in life and try to live harmoniously with the younger generation as for as possible. It may be pointed out that recently the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that the benefits conferred on a Government employee, who is disabled during his/her service period, under Section 47 of Persons with Disabilities (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) Act, 1995 cannot be confined only seven types of medical conditions defined as \u2018disability\u2019 in the Act. The seven medical conditions are blindness, low vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impaired, locomotor disability, mental retardation and mental illness. A Division Bench comprising Justice F.M.Ibrahim and Justice K.Venkataraman said : \u201cWe feel that the court cannot shut its eyes if a person knocks at its doors claiming relief under the Act. In a welfare State like India, the benefits of benevolent legislation cannot be denied on the ground of mere hyper technicalities. It may be noted that this Act is not directly related to aged person but seven medical conditions which prescribed in this Act are the common symptom of the aged person. Need For A Change In Approach: In the older times, after the completion of 50 years of life, one had to detach oneself from the responsibilities of a \u2018Grihastha\u2019 and switch over to the third stage of human life which was known as \u2018Vanpristha\u2019 which referred to the devotion of the next 25 years of life by the \u2018Vanpristhi\u2019 by mana, vachana and karma to the selfless service of the suffering humanity and the larger society in return to the services received form society during the first 50 years of life. Certain strategies and approaches at different levels of policy making, planning and programming etc. will have to be adopted in order to harness this vast human resource for promoting the involvement and participation of senior citizens in socio-economic development process on a much larger scale. This participation must result in an end to their social isolation ad an increase in their general satisfaction with their life. Any attempt to secure the help of the elderly in offering their service to the nation must simultaneously ensure some sort of package of services aimed at arranging for them a better quality of life and a well-designed social security network for the senior citizen. The society and the state in India need to accept the challenge of their effectively focusing their attention on the following twin issues of: (i) How to provide a fair-deal to the senior citizens so that they are able to peacefully, constructively and satisfactorily pass their lives; and (ii) How to utilize the vast treasure of knowledge and rich life experience of the older people so that they are able to utilize their remaining energies and contribute to the all round development of their nation. Palliative Care: Need of the hour : According to a pilot survey, 70% of city\u2019s elderly population is undergoing some kind of medication. The average spending per day ranges between Rs. 3 to 200. However, nearly half of the money goes waste. The reason is absence of proper palliative care in the country. World Health Organization has marked October 7 as a day to create awareness about the importance and need for hospice and palliative care. \u201cAccess to the best quality care, while facing terminal illness is a human right. Ironically, many people in the world are denied this right. The bitter side is that government in many countries does not even realize the important of this right\u201d said geriatric physician Dr. Abhishek Shukla. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 THE ACT WILL be enforced by the State government concerned. The date on which the Act will come into force will be notified by the State government concerned in the Official Gazette. Under Clause 5(1) of the Bill, a senior citizen or a parent may apply for maintenance under Clause 4 of the bill. (A senior citizen is an Indian citizen who is at least 60 years old. A parent could be father or mother, whether biological, adoptive or step father or step mother, whether or not the father or the mother is a senior citizen). If the senior citizen or parent is incapable, any other person or a voluntary organization authorized by the senior citizen or parent can apply for maintenance on their behalf. The Tribunal may take cognizance suo motu (that is, it can act on its own cognizance). These two provisions are welcome since most senior citizens or parents do not have the energy (they do not have the money anyway) to apply for maintenance. The said Tribunal may, when a proceeding regarding monthly allowance for the maintenance under this section is pending, order such children or relative to pay a monthly allowance for the interim maintenance of the senior citizen including parent. The State government is required to constitute within a period of 6 months from the date of commencement of the law (Act), Tribunals for the purpose of adjudicating and deciding upon the order for maintenance under Clause 5. According to Clause 4(1), the senior citizen including parent is entitled to apply for maintenance under Clause 5 if he is unable to maintain himself from his own earnings or out of the property owned by him. A parent or grand-parent can make an application for maintenance against one or more of his children who are majors (\u2018children\u2019 includes son, daughter, grandson and grand-daughter). The obligation of the children to maintain his or her parent extends to the needs of such parent either father or mother or both, as the case may be, so that such parent may lead a normal life. A childless senior citizen, on the other hand, can make an application against his relative (\"relative\" means any legal heir of the childless senior citizen who is a major and is in possession of or would inherit the property after the childless senior citizen\u2019s death; property means property of any kind, whether movable or immovable, ancestral or self-acquired, tangible or intangible and includes rights or interests in such property). Thus Clause 4 makes a reference to grand-parent while Clause 5 does not. In other words, Clause 5 is silent about how the application for maintenance should be made by a grand-parent (who is not yet 60) under Clause 4. I wish the learned law-makers took notice of this inconsistency lest vested interests should exploit this well-intended provision. If the senior citizen has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition that the relative shall provide the basic amenities and basic physical needs to the senior citizen and such relative refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, Clause 23 (1) says the said transfer of property shall be declared void by the Tribunal, if the senior citizen so desires. This is a welcome provision since it protects na\u00efve senior citizens from exploitation by relatives who intend to renege on their promise subsequently. The State government is also required to prescribe a comprehensive action plan for protecting the life and property of senior citizens. This is also a welcome provision since the vulnerable senior citizen can be easily harmed or hurt. In fact the senior citizen may be even carted away somewhere to ensure that none else including the voluntary organization and the Tribunal come to know of their whereabouts. Fortunately Clause 24 of the Bill takes care of this aspect. According to this Clause, \u2018Whoever, having the care or protection of senior citizen leaves, such senior citizen in any place with the intention of wholly abandoning such senior citizen, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months or fine which may extend to five thousands rupees or with both\u2019. I suggest registration of senior citizens with the jurisdictional police station be mandated. The NGO concerned may be requested to visit senior citizens at least every quarter under intimation to the jurisdictional police station. Obviously, the Bill, in its present form, will meet the needs of only parents and senior citizens from educated families, propertied classes and the urban areas. It cannot cater to the needs of parents and senior citizens belonging to the poorer sections of society or hailing from villages. One may find three generations living in the same village and at times even under the same roof! If the son is also indigent, how can he maintain his parent and grand parent? How would the Tribunal adjudicate such disputes? The son will be only too happy if he is put behind bars because he is at least assured of two square meals a day. Understandably, given its limited resources, one cannot expect the government to do a thorough job here. But it can at least ameliorate the situation. How? It should allow income tax sops to those who take care of parents / grand-parents / senior citizens. This is only fair because if tax is collected from citizens, they should be provided social security by the government when they grow old. When the government is not able to provide social security, it should at least encourage the citizens to provide it by allowing income tax sops. After all, a citizen taking care of his aged parents or senior citizens is providing them social security which strictly speaking the government should have provided. Our government taxes individuals a la the US government but unlike the US government does not provide social security to all citizens. I have pointed out this anomaly in my article, \u201cWhy Tirupur has raced ahead of Ludhiana?\u201d dated, Nov 20, 2007. All that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul. It is also unfortunate that the government has not made any serious attempt to cover the senior citizens under \u201cGroup Health Insurance Scheme\u201d. It believes that insurance coverage is mostly required in critical illness and at places where adequately-equipped hospitals are not available (!). Well, for a start, let the government convince me that AIIMS, New Delhi, is adequately equipped to treat indigent senior citizens. The Bill does not cover old age pension perhaps because State governments are implementing the Old Age Pension Scheme. But the amount of pension and the eligibility criteria are not uniform across the States, under the said Scheme. The Bill should have mandated the State governments to pay old age pension to the senior citizens adequately and uniformly across the country. This should not be difficult because all that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul. It has to deny income tax sops to those who do not maintain parents / grand parents / relatives; it has to deny old age pension to those parents / grand parents / relatives who are being maintained by their children / relatives. Lastly, the government, while drafting Bills, uses the word \u2018may\u2019 (instead of the word \u2018shall\u2019) even where provisions of a mandatory nature are involved. What leads to this howler? Is it ignorance or lack of conviction on the part of the government? Note: Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Meira Kumar tabled the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 in the Lok Sabha. The Bill proposes to make it obligatory on the persons who inherit the property of their aged relatives to maintain them. It also aims to make provisions for setting up old age homes to take care of indigent older persons. It aims to set up an appropriate mechanism for need-based maintenance to parents and senior citizens, better medical facilities and old age homes in every district. It seeks for institutionalisation of a suitable mechanism for the protection of the life and property of older persons. Describing ageing as a major challenge and the need to give more attention to the care and protection of the older person, the statement of objects and reasons said many older persons, particularly widowed women, are now forced to spend their twilight years all alone and face emotional neglect and lack physical and financial support. Though the parents can claim maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the procedure is both time- consuming as well as expensive. Hence, there is need to have simple, inexpensive and speedy provisions to claim maintenance, the statement said. A critique of the Maintenance of Parents Bill 2007 On May 8, 2007, the Indian Express carried a critique of the UPA government's Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill 2007, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in March. M. R. Madhavan, who works with the PRS Legislative Research at the Centre for Policy Research focuses on larger policy problems with the Bill, while also zeroing in on specific provisions that arouse his concern: \"The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007, which was introduced in Lok Sabha in March, aims \u201cto provide for more effective provisions for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens guaranteed and recognised under the Constitution and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\u201d While it is difficult to contest the objective of ensuring a comfortable life for senior citizens, a number of provisions in the Bill may not be easy to implement. The Bill neatly sidesteps the directive in the Constitution (Article 41), which directs the state to provide public assistance in cases of old age. The Bill does state that, \u201cThe state government may establish and maintain such number of old age homes at accessible places, as it may deem necessary, in a phased manner, beginning with at least one in each district to accommodate in such homes a minimum of one hundred fifty senior citizens who are indigent\u201d. Note the use of \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d \u2014 there is no obligation on the state governments to establish these. Even without this clause, there was never any prohibition on them from providing old age homes. Also, one wonders why a Bill should specify details such as the minimum size of an old age home. Instead, the Bill places the obligation of maintaining a senior citizen on his or her children, grandchildren or any legal heirs. The process and amount differs from the existing provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Section 125), under which a first class magistrate may order a person to provide a monthly maintenance to his parents (or wife, including divorced wife or children), limited to Rs 500. The Bill provides that the children of a senior citizen have the obligation to maintain a senior citizen to the extent that he \u201cmay lead a normal life\u201d. In case of a childless senior citizen, the obligation is on a relative who is in possession of the senior citizen\u2019s property or who would inherit his property. The maximum monthly allowance is to be specified by state governments, subject to a limit of Rs 10,000. VSome of the definitions in the Bill are confusing. Senior citizens are defined as \u201cany person being a citizen of India, who has attained the age of sixty years or above and includes parent whether or not a senior citizen\u201d. This implies that every parent, including those below sixty years of age, would be considered a \u201csenior citizen\u201d. Relative \u201cmeans any legal heir of the childless senior citizen who is not a minor and is in possession of or would inherit his property after his death.\u201d How does one determine who would inherit the property? Does this mean that the senior citizen has to reveal the contents of his will, and does not have the freedom to change it later? If he is allowed to change his will, consider the case of the person who is initially named in the will, forced to provide a maintenance, and who finds on the death of the senior citizen that there is another will that disinherits him. So what does a senior citizen do if he wants maintenance? He applies to the \u2018Maintenance Tribunal\u2019. The application may also be made by any other person or organisation authorized by him. However, the Bill clarifies that such an \u201corganisation\u201d means \u201cany voluntary organisation registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, or any other law for the time being in force\u201d. It seems to ignore the fact that the Societies Registration Act does not define \u201cvoluntary organisation\u201d. One might be tempted to believe that the purpose of permitting such organisations is to assist a senior citizen. However, the Bill makes it clear that \u201cno party to a proceeding before a tribunal or appellate tribunal shall be represented by a legal practitioner\u201d. That is, one may not use the services of a legally qualified person in obtaining one\u2019s legal entitlements under this law. Regarding the maintenance tribunal, the Bill states that \u201cthe state government may... constitute for each sub-division one or more tribunals... The tribunal shall be presided over by an officer not below the rank of sub-divisional officer of a state\u201d. There are two points to note here. First, the use of \u201cmay\u201d, leaving the state governments the option of not forming such tribunals. Second, the job is entrusted to the SDO, who has a number of other responsibilities. To conclude, one is not arguing against the idea of providing a safety net for senior citizens. The point is that any law that provides for such a net should be implement able. Other than the various loopholes discussed, the big issue is whether parents would take their children to the tribunal, given various social pressures. A better approach may be to design a social security system, including financial products such as pension schemes and reverse mortgages that enable the elderly to live a dignified life.\" This is a powerful critique of the Bill, which is scheduled to be debated during the current session of Parliament. To my mind, there is only one existing precedent for such a law, which is the Singaporean Maintenance of Parents Act. Significantly, that law is backed by governmental programmes of pension, healthcare and other forms of support for the elderly, which adds weight to Madhavan's core argument. Hopefully, these issues will be aired during the Parliamentary debates on this law.",

As per the UNESCO estimates, \n\nthe number of the aged(60+) is likely to 590 million in 2005. The figure will double by 2025. By 2025, the \n\nworld will have more elderly than young people and cross two billion mark by 2050. In India also, the \n\npopulation of elder persons has increased form nearly 2 crores in 1951 to 7.2 crores in 2001. In other \n\nwords about 8% of the total population is above 60 years. The figure will cross 18 % mark by 2025. Problems of The Aged Problems of the aged as follows: Economic problems, include such problems as loss of employment, income deficiency and economic\n\ninsecurity. Physical and physiological problems, include health and medical problems, nutritional deficiency, and\n\nthe problem of adequate housing etc. Psycho-social problem which cover problems related with their psychological and social\n\nmaladjustment as well as the problem of elder abuse etc. International Efforts The question of ageing was first debated at the United Nations in 1948 at the initiative of Argentina. The \n\nissue was again raised by Malta in 1969. In 1971 the General Assembly asked the Secretary-General to \n\nprepare a comprehensive report on the elderly and to suggest guideline for the national and \n\ninternational action. In 1978, Assembly decided to hold a World Conference on the Ageing. Accordingly, \n\nthe World Assembly on Ageing was held in Vienna from July 26 to August 6, 1982 wherein an \n\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted. The overall goal of the Plan was to strengthen the \n\nability of individual countries to deal effectively with the ageing in their population, keeping in mind the \n\nspecial concerns and needs of the elderly. The Plan attempted to promote understanding of the social, \n\neconomic and cultural implications of ageing and of related humanitarian and developed issues. The \n\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted by the General Assembly in 1982 and the Assembly \n\nin subsequent years called on governments to continue to implement its principles and \n\nrecommendations. The Assembly urged the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to ensure that \n\nfollow-up action to the Plan is carried out effectively. In 1992, the U.N.General Assembly adopted the proclamation to observe the year 1999 as he\n\nInternational Year of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly has declared \u201cIst October\u201d as the International Day for the Elderly, later\n\nrechristened as the International Day of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly on December 16, 1991 adopted 18 principles which are organized into 5\n\nclusters, namely-independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment, and dignity of the older persons. These principles provide a broad framework for action on ageing. Some of the Principles are as follows Older Persons should have the opportunity to work and determine when to leave the work force. Older Persons should remain integrated in society and participate actively in the formulation of\n\npolicies which effect their well-being. Older Persons should have access to health care to help them maintain the optimum level of\n\nphysical, mental and emotional well-being. Older Persons should be able to pursue opportunities for the full development of their potential and\n\nhave access to educational, cultural, spiritual and recreational resources of society. Older Persons should be able to live in dignity and security and should be free from exploitation and\n\nmental and physical abuse. National Efforts (I) Constitutional Protection: Art. 41 : Right to work, to education and to public assistance in certain cases : The State shall, within the \n\nlimits of economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to \n\neducation and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in \n\nother cases of undeserved want. Art. 46 : Promotion of educational and economic interests of \u2026\u2026. and other weaker sections : The State \n\nshall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the \n\npeople\u2026..and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. However, these provision are included in the Chapter IV i.e., Directive Principles of the Indian \n\nConstitution. The Directive Principles, as stated in Article 37, are not enforceable by any court of law. \n\nBut Directive Principles impose positive obligations on the state, i.e., what it should do. The Directive \n\nPrinciples have been declared to be fundamental in the governance of the country and the state has \n\nbeen placed under an obligation to apply them in making laws. The courts however cannot enforce a \n\nDirective Principle as it does not create any justiciable right in favour of any individual. It is most \n\nunfortunate that state has not made even a single Act which are directly related to the elderly persons. (II) Legal Protections: Under Personal Laws: The moral duty to maintain parents is recognized by all people. However, so far as law is concerned, the \n\nposition and extent of such liability varies from community to community. (I) Hindus Laws: Amongst the Hindus, the obligation of sons to maintain their aged parents, who were not able to \n\nmaintain themselves out of their own earning and property, was recognized even in early texts. And this \n\nobligation was not dependent upon, or in any way qualified, by a reference to the possession of family \n\nproperty. It was a personal legal obligation enforceable by the sovereign or the state. The statutory \n\nprovision for maintenance of parents under Hindu personal law is contained in Sec 20 of the Hindu \n\nAdoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. This Act is the first personal law statute in India, which imposes \n\nan obligation on the children to maintain their parents. As is evident from the wording of the section, \n\nthe obligation to maintain parents is not confined to sons only, and daughters also have an equal duty \n\ntowards parents. It is important to note that only those parents who are financially unable to maintain \n\nthemselves from any source, are entitled to seek maintenance under this Act. (II) Muslim Law: Children have a duty to maintain their aged parents even under the Muslim law. According to Mulla : (a) Children in easy circumstances are bound to maintain their poor parents, although the latter may be \n\nable to earn something for themselves. (b) A son though in strained circumstances is bound to maintain his mother, if the mother is poor, \n\nthough she may not be infirm. (c) A son, who though poor, is earning something, is bound to support his father who earns nothing.\n\nAccording to Tyabji, parents and grandparents in indigent circumstances are entitled, under Hanafi law, \n\nto maintenance from their children and grandchildren who have the means, even if they are able to earn \n\ntheir livelihood. Both sons and daughters have a duty to maintain their parents under the Muslim law. \n\nThe obligation, however, is dependent on their having the means to do so. (III) Christian And Parsi Law: The Christians and Parsis have no personal laws providing for maintenance for the parents. Parents who\n\nwish to seek maintenance have to apply under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. (III) Under The Code of Criminal Procedure: Prior to 1973, there was no provision for maintenance of parents under the code. The Law Commission, \n\nhowever, was not in favour of making such provision. According to its report: The Cr.P.C is not the proper place for such a provision. There will be considerably difficulty in the \n\namount of maintenance awarded to parents apportioning amongst the children in a summary \n\nproceeding of this type. It is desirable to leave this matter for adjudication by civil courts. The provision, however, was introduced for the first time in Sec. 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure \n\nin 1973. It is also essential that the parent establishes that the other party has sufficient means and has \n\nneglected or refused to maintain his, i.e., the parent, who is unable to maintain himself. It is important \n\nto note that Cr.P.C 1973, is a secular law and governs persons belonging to all religions and \n\ncommunities. Daughters, including married daughters, also have a duty to maintain their parents. (IV) Governmental Protections: 1. The Government of India approved the National Policy for Older Persons on January 13, 1999 in order \n\nto accelerate welfare measures and empowering the elderly in ways beneficial for them. This policy \n\nincluded the following major steps : Setting up of a pension fund for ensuring security for those persons who have been serving in the\n\nunorganized sector, Construction of old age homes and day care centers for every 3-4 districts, Establishment of resource centers and re-employment bureaus for people above 60 years, Concessional rail/air fares for travel within and between cities, i.e.,30% discount in train and 50% in\n\nIndian Airlines. Enacting legislation for ensuring compulsory geriatric care in all the public hospitals. 2. The Ministry of Justice and Empowerment has announced regarding the setting up of a National \n\nCouncil for Older Person, called agewell Foundation. It will seek opinion of aged on measures to make \n\nlife easier for them. 3. Attempts to sensitise school children to live and work with the elderly. Setting up of a round the clock \n\nhelp line and discouraging social ostracism of the older persons are being taken up. 4. The government policy encourages a prompt settlement of pension, provident fund (PF), gratuity, etc. \n\nin order to save the superannuated persons from any hardships. It also encourages to make the taxation \n\npolicies elder sensitive. 5. The policy also accords high priority to their health care needs. 6. According to Sec.88-B, 88-D and 88-DDB of Income Tax Act there are discount in tax for the elderly\n\npersons. 7. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has also been providing several scheme for the benefit of \n\naged persons, i.e., Jeevan Dhara Yojana, Jeevan Akshay Yojana, Senior Citizen Unit Yojana, Medical \n\nInsurance Yojana. 8. Former Prime Minister A.B.Bajpai was also launch \u2018Annapurana Yojana\u2019 for the benefit of aged \n\npersons. Under this yojana unattended aged persons are being given 10 kg food for every month. 9. It is proposed to allot 10 percent of the houses constructed under government schemes for the urban \n\nand rural lower income segments to the older persons on easy loan. The policy mentions: The layout of the housing colonies will respond to the needs and life styles of the elderly so that there is \n\nno physical barriers to their mobility; they are allotted ground floor; and their social interaction with \n\nolder society members exists. Despite all these attempts, there is need to impress upon the elderly about the need to adjust to the \n\nchanging circumstances in life and try to live harmoniously with the younger generation as for as \n\npossible. It may be pointed out that recently the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that the \n\nbenefits conferred on a Government employee, who is disabled during his/her service period, under \n\nSection 47 of Persons with Disabilities (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) \n\nAct, 1995 cannot be confined only seven types of medical conditions defined as \u2018disability\u2019 in the Act. \n\nThe seven medical conditions are blindness, low vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impaired, locomotor \n\ndisability, mental retardation and mental illness. A Division Bench comprising Justice F.M.Ibrahim and \n\nJustice K.Venkataraman said : \u201cWe feel that the court cannot shut its eyes if a person knocks at its doors \n\nclaiming relief under the Act. In a welfare State like India, the benefits of benevolent legislation cannot \n\nbe denied on the ground of mere hyper technicalities. It may be noted that this Act is not directly \n\nrelated to aged person but seven medical conditions which prescribed in this Act are the common \n\nsymptom of the aged person. Need For A Change In Approach: In the older times, after the completion of 50 years of life, one had to detach oneself from the \n\nresponsibilities of a \u2018Grihastha\u2019 and switch over to the third stage of human life which was known as \n\n\u2018Vanpristha\u2019 which referred to the devotion of the next 25 years of life by the \u2018Vanpristhi\u2019 by mana, \n\nvachana and karma to the selfless service of the suffering humanity and the larger society in return to \n\nthe services received form society during the first 50 years of life. Certain strategies and approaches at different levels of policy making, planning and programming etc. \n\nwill have to be adopted in order to harness this vast human resource for promoting the involvement and \n\nparticipation of senior citizens in socio-economic development process on a much larger scale.\n\nThis participation must result in an end to their social isolation ad an increase in their general \n\nsatisfaction with their life. Any attempt to secure the help of the elderly in offering their service to the \n\nnation must simultaneously ensure some sort of package of services aimed at arranging for them a \n\nbetter quality of life and a well-designed social security network for the senior citizen. The society and \n\nthe state in India need to accept the challenge of their effectively focusing their attention on the \n\nfollowing twin issues of: (i) How to provide a fair-deal to the senior citizens so that they are able to peacefully, constructively and \n\nsatisfactorily pass their lives; and (ii) How to utilize the vast treasure of knowledge and rich life experience of the older people so that \n\nthey are able to utilize their remaining energies and contribute to the all round development of their \n\nnation. Palliative Care: Need of the hour : According to a pilot survey, 70% of city\u2019s elderly population is \n\nundergoing some kind of medication. The average spending per day ranges between Rs. 3 to 200. \n\nHowever, nearly half of the money goes waste. The reason is absence of proper palliative care in the \n\ncountry. World Health Organization has marked October 7 as a day to create awareness about the \n\nimportance and need for hospice and palliative care. \u201cAccess to the best quality care, while facing \n\nterminal illness is a human right. Ironically, many people in the world are denied this right. The bitter \n\nside is that government in many countries does not even realize the important of this right\u201d said \n\ngeriatric physician Dr. Abhishek Shukla. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 THE ACT WILL be enforced by the State government concerned. The date on which the Act will come \n\ninto force will be notified by the State government concerned in the Official Gazette. Under Clause 5(1) of the Bill, a senior citizen or a parent may apply for maintenance under Clause 4 of \n\nthe bill. (A senior citizen is an Indian citizen who is at least 60 years old. A parent could be father or \n\nmother, whether biological, adoptive or step father or step mother, whether or not the father or the \n\nmother is a senior citizen). If the senior citizen or parent is incapable, any other person or a voluntary \n\norganization authorized by the senior citizen or parent can apply for maintenance on their behalf. The \n\nTribunal may take cognizance suo motu (that is, it can act on its own cognizance). These two provisions \n\nare welcome since most senior citizens or parents do not have the energy (they do not have the money \n\nanyway) to apply for maintenance. The said Tribunal may, when a proceeding regarding monthly allowance for the maintenance under this \n\nsection is pending, order such children or relative to pay a monthly allowance for the interim \n\nmaintenance of the senior citizen including parent. The State government is required to constitute \n\nwithin a period of 6 months from the date of commencement of the law (Act), Tribunals for the purpose \n\nof adjudicating and deciding upon the order for maintenance under Clause 5. According to Clause 4(1), the senior citizen including parent is entitled to apply for maintenance under \n\nClause 5 if he is unable to maintain himself from his own earnings or out of the property owned by him. \n\nA parent or grand-parent can make an application for maintenance against one or more of his children \n\nwho are majors (\u2018children\u2019 includes son, daughter, grandson and grand-daughter). The obligation of the \n\nchildren to maintain his or her parent extends to the needs of such parent either father or mother or \n\nboth, as the case may be, so that such parent may lead a normal life. A childless senior citizen, on the \n\nother hand, can make an application against his relative (\"relative\" means any legal heir of the childless \n\nsenior citizen who is a major and is in possession of or would inherit the property after the childless \n\nsenior citizen\u2019s death; property means property of any kind, whether movable or immovable, ancestral \n\nor self-acquired, tangible or intangible and includes rights or interests in such property). Thus Clause 4 makes a reference to grand-parent while Clause 5 does not. In other words, Clause 5 is\n\nsilent about how the application for maintenance should be made by a grand-parent (who is not yet 60) \n\nunder Clause 4. I wish the learned law-makers took notice of this inconsistency lest vested interests \n\nshould exploit this well-intended provision. If the senior citizen has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition \n\nthat the relative shall provide the basic amenities and basic physical needs to the senior citizen and such \n\nrelative refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, Clause 23 (1) says the said transfer \n\nof property shall be declared void by the Tribunal, if the senior citizen so desires. This is a welcome \n\nprovision since it protects na\u00efve senior citizens from exploitation by relatives who intend to renege on \n\ntheir promise subsequently. The State government is also required to prescribe a comprehensive action plan for protecting the life \n\nand property of senior citizens. This is also a welcome provision since the vulnerable senior citizen can \n\nbe easily harmed or hurt. In fact the senior citizen may be even carted away somewhere to ensure that \n\nnone else including the voluntary organization and the Tribunal come to know of their whereabouts. \n\nFortunately Clause 24 of the Bill takes care of this aspect. According to this Clause, \u2018Whoever, having the \n\ncare or protection of senior citizen leaves, such senior citizen in any place with the intention of wholly \n\nabandoning such senior citizen, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term \n\nwhich may extend to three months or fine which may extend to five thousands rupees or with both\u2019. I \n\nsuggest registration of senior citizens with the jurisdictional police station be mandated. The NGO \n\nconcerned may be requested to visit senior citizens at least every quarter under intimation to the \n\njurisdictional police station. Obviously, the Bill, in its present form, will meet the needs of only parents and senior citizens from \n\neducated families, propertied classes and the urban areas. It cannot cater to the needs of parents and \n\nsenior citizens belonging to the poorer sections of society or hailing from villages. One may find three \n\ngenerations living in the same village and at times even under the same roof! If the son is also indigent, \n\nhow can he maintain his parent and grand parent? How would the Tribunal adjudicate such disputes? \n\nThe son will be only too happy if he is put behind bars because he is at least assured of two square \n\nmeals a day. Understandably, given its limited resources, one cannot expect the government to do a thorough job \n\nhere. But it can at least ameliorate the situation. How? It should allow income tax sops to those who \n\ntake care of parents / grand-parents / senior citizens. This is only fair because if tax is collected from \n\ncitizens, they should be provided social security by the government when they grow old. When the \n\ngovernment is not able to provide social security, it should at least encourage the citizens to provide it \n\nby allowing income tax sops. After all, a citizen taking care of his aged parents or senior citizens is \n\nproviding them social security which strictly speaking the government should have provided. Our \n\ngovernment taxes individuals a la the US government but unlike the US government does not provide \n\nsocial security to all citizens. I have pointed out this anomaly in my article, \u201cWhy Tirupur has raced \n\nahead of Ludhiana?\u201d dated, Nov 20, 2007. All that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul.\n\nIt is also unfortunate that the government has not made any serious attempt to cover the senior citizens \n\nunder \u201cGroup Health Insurance Scheme\u201d. It believes that insurance coverage is mostly required in \n\ncritical illness and at places where adequately-equipped hospitals are not available (!). Well, for a start, \n\nlet the government convince me that AIIMS, New Delhi, is adequately equipped to treat indigent senior \n\ncitizens. The Bill does not cover old age pension perhaps because State governments are implementing the Old \n\nAge Pension Scheme. But the amount of pension and the eligibility criteria are not uniform across the \n\nStates, under the said Scheme. The Bill should have mandated the State governments to pay old age \n\npension to the senior citizens adequately and uniformly across the country. This should not be difficult \n\nbecause all that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul. It has to deny income tax sops to \n\nthose who do not maintain parents / grand parents / relatives; it has to deny old age pension to those \n\nparents / grand parents / relatives who are being maintained by their children / relatives.\n\nLastly, the government, while drafting Bills, uses the word \u2018may\u2019 (instead of the word \u2018shall\u2019) even where \n\nprovisions of a mandatory nature are involved. What leads to this howler? Is it ignorance or lack of \n\nconviction on the part of the government? Note: Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Meira Kumar tabled the Maintenance and \n\nWelfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 in the Lok Sabha. The Bill proposes to make it obligatory \n\non the persons who inherit the property of their aged relatives to maintain them. It also aims to make \n\nprovisions for setting up old age homes to take care of indigent older persons. It aims to set up an \n\nappropriate mechanism for need-based maintenance to parents and senior citizens, better medical \n\nfacilities and old age homes in every district. It seeks for institutionalisation of a suitable mechanism for \n\nthe protection of the life and property of older persons. Describing ageing as a major challenge and the \n\nneed to give more attention to the care and protection of the older person, the statement of objects \n\nand reasons said many older persons, particularly widowed women, are now forced to spend their \n\ntwilight years all alone and face emotional neglect and lack physical and financial support. Though the \n\nparents can claim maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the procedure is both time-\n\nconsuming as well as expensive. Hence, there is need to have simple, inexpensive and speedy provisions \n\nto claim maintenance, the statement said. A critique of the Maintenance of Parents Bill 2007 On May 8, 2007, the Indian Express carried a critique of the UPA government's Maintenance and \n\nWelfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill 2007, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in March. M. R. \n\nMadhavan, who works with the PRS Legislative Research at the Centre for Policy Research focuses on \n\nlarger policy problems with the Bill, while also zeroing in on specific provisions that arouse his concern: \"The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007, which was introduced in Lok \n\nSabha in March, aims \u201cto provide for more effective provisions for the maintenance and welfare of \n\nparents and senior citizens guaranteed and recognised under the Constitution and for matters \n\nconnected therewith or incidental thereto.\u201d While it is difficult to contest the objective of ensuring a \n\ncomfortable life for senior citizens, a number of provisions in the Bill may not be easy to implement. The Bill neatly sidesteps the directive in the Constitution (Article 41), which directs the state to provide \n\npublic assistance in cases of old age. The Bill does state that, \u201cThe state government may establish and \n\nmaintain such number of old age homes at accessible places, as it may deem necessary, in a phased \n\nmanner, beginning with at least one in each district to accommodate in such homes a minimum of one \n\nhundred fifty senior citizens who are indigent\u201d. Note the use of \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d \u2014 there is no \n\nobligation on the state governments to establish these. Even without this clause, there was never any \n\nprohibition on them from providing old age homes. Also, one wonders why a Bill should specify details \n\nsuch as the minimum size of an old age home. Instead, the Bill places the obligation of maintaining a senior citizen on his or her children, grandchildren \n\nor any legal heirs. The process and amount differs from the existing provision in the Code of Criminal \n\nProcedure (Section 125), under which a first class magistrate may order a person to provide a monthly \n\nmaintenance to his parents (or wife, including divorced wife or children), limited to Rs 500. The Bill provides that the children of a senior citizen have the obligation to maintain a senior citizen to\n\nthe extent that he \u201cmay lead a normal life\u201d. In case of a childless senior citizen, the obligation is on a \n\nrelative who is in possession of the senior citizen\u2019s property or who would inherit his property. The \n\nmaximum monthly allowance is to be specified by state governments, subject to a limit of Rs 10,000. VSome of the definitions in the Bill are confusing. Senior citizens are defined as \u201cany person being a \n\ncitizen of India, who has attained the age of sixty years or above and includes parent whether or not a \n\nsenior citizen\u201d. This implies that every parent, including those below sixty years of age, would be considered a \u201csenior citizen\u201d. Relative \u201cmeans any legal heir of the childless senior citizen who is not a \n\nminor and is in possession of or would inherit his property after his death.\u201d How does one determine \n\nwho would inherit the property? Does this mean that the senior citizen has to reveal the contents of his \n\nwill, and does not have the freedom to change it later? If he is allowed to change his will, consider the \n\ncase of the person who is initially named in the will, forced to provide a maintenance, and who finds on \n\nthe death of the senior citizen that there is another will that disinherits him. So what does a senior citizen do if he wants maintenance? He applies to the \u2018Maintenance Tribunal\u2019. The \n\napplication may also be made by any other person or organisation authorized by him. However, the Bill \n\nclarifies that such an \u201corganisation\u201d means \u201cany voluntary organisation registered under the Societies \n\nRegistration Act, 1860, or any other law for the time being in force\u201d. It seems to ignore the fact that the \n\nSocieties Registration Act does not define \u201cvoluntary organisation\u201d. One might be tempted to believe that the purpose of permitting such organisations is to assist a senior \n\ncitizen. However, the Bill makes it clear that \u201cno party to a proceeding before a tribunal or appellate \n\ntribunal shall be represented by a legal practitioner\u201d. That is, one may not use the services of a legally \n\nqualified person in obtaining one\u2019s legal entitlements under this law. Regarding the maintenance tribunal, the Bill states that \u201cthe state government may... constitute for \n\neach sub-division one or more tribunals... The tribunal shall be presided over by an officer not below the \n\nrank of sub-divisional officer of a state\u201d. There are two points to note here. First, the use of \u201cmay\u201d, \n\nleaving the state governments the option of not forming such tribunals. Second, the job is entrusted to \n\nthe SDO, who has a number of other responsibilities. To conclude, one is not arguing against the idea of providing a safety net for senior citizens. The point is \n\nthat any law that provides for such a net should be implement able. Other than the various loopholes \n\ndiscussed, the big issue is whether parents would take their children to the tribunal, given various social \n\npressures. A better approach may be to design a social security system, including financial products such \n\nas pension schemes and reverse mortgages that enable the elderly to live a dignified life.\" This is a powerful critique of the Bill, which is scheduled to be debated during the current session of \n\nParliament. To my mind, there is only one existing precedent for such a law, which is the Singaporean \n\nMaintenance of Parents Act. Significantly, that law is backed by governmental programmes of pension, \n\nhealthcare and other forms of support for the elderly, which adds weight to Madhavan's core argument. \n\nHopefully, these issues will be aired during the Parliamentary debates on this law."

As per the UNESCO estimates, the number of the aged(60+) is likely to 590 million in 2005. The figure will double by 2025. By 2025, the world will have more elderly than young people and cross two billion mark by 2050. In India also, the population of elder persons has increased form nearly 2 crores in 1951 to 7.2 crores in 2001. In other words about 8% of the total population is above 60 years. The figure will cross 18 % mark by 2025. Problems of The Aged Problems of the aged as follows: Economic problems, include such problems as loss of employment, income deficiency and economic insecurity. Physical and physiological problems, include health and medical problems, nutritional deficiency, and the problem of adequate housing etc. Psycho-social problem which cover problems related with their psychological and social maladjustment as well as the problem of elder abuse etc. International Efforts The question of ageing was first debated at the United Nations in 1948 at the initiative of Argentina. The issue was again raised by Malta in 1969. In 1971 the General Assembly asked the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report on the elderly and to suggest guideline for the national and international action. In 1978, Assembly decided to hold a World Conference on the Ageing. Accordingly, the World Assembly on Ageing was held in Vienna from July 26 to August 6, 1982 wherein an International Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted. The overall goal of the Plan was to strengthen the ability of individual countries to deal effectively with the ageing in their population, keeping in mind the special concerns and needs of the elderly. The Plan attempted to promote understanding of the social, economic and cultural implications of ageing and of related humanitarian and developed issues. The International Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted by the General Assembly in 1982 and the Assembly in subsequent years called on governments to continue to implement its principles and recommendations. The Assembly urged the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to ensure that follow-up action to the Plan is carried out effectively. In 1992, the U.N.General Assembly adopted the proclamation to observe the year 1999 as he International Year of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly has declared \u201cIst October\u201d as the International Day for the Elderly, later rechristened as the International Day of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly on December 16, 1991 adopted 18 principles which are organized into 5 clusters, namely-independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment, and dignity of the older persons. These principles provide a broad framework for action on ageing. Some of the Principles are as follows Older Persons should have the opportunity to work and determine when to leave the work force. Older Persons should remain integrated in society and participate actively in the formulation of policies which effect their well-being. Older Persons should have access to health care to help them maintain the optimum level of physical, mental and emotional well-being. Older Persons should be able to pursue opportunities for the full development of their potential and have access to educational, cultural, spiritual and recreational resources of society. Older Persons should be able to live in dignity and security and should be free from exploitation and mental and physical abuse. National Efforts (I) Constitutional Protection: Art. 41 : Right to work, to education and to public assistance in certain cases : The State shall, within the limits of economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want. Art. 46 : Promotion of educational and economic interests of \u2026\u2026. and other weaker sections : The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people\u2026..and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. However, these provision are included in the Chapter IV i.e., Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution. The Directive Principles, as stated in Article 37, are not enforceable by any court of law. But Directive Principles impose positive obligations on the state, i.e., what it should do. The Directive Principles have been declared to be fundamental in the governance of the country and the state has been placed under an obligation to apply them in making laws. The courts however cannot enforce a Directive Principle as it does not create any justiciable right in favour of any individual. It is most unfortunate that state has not made even a single Act which are directly related to the elderly persons. (II) Legal Protections: Under Personal Laws: The moral duty to maintain parents is recognized by all people. However, so far as law is concerned, the position and extent of such liability varies from community to community. (I) Hindus Laws: Amongst the Hindus, the obligation of sons to maintain their aged parents, who were not able to maintain themselves out of their own earning and property, was recognized even in early texts. And this obligation was not dependent upon, or in any way qualified, by a reference to the possession of family property. It was a personal legal obligation enforceable by the sovereign or the state. The statutory provision for maintenance of parents under Hindu personal law is contained in Sec 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. This Act is the first personal law statute in India, which imposes an obligation on the children to maintain their parents. As is evident from the wording of the section, the obligation to maintain parents is not confined to sons only, and daughters also have an equal duty towards parents. It is important to note that only those parents who are financially unable to maintain themselves from any source, are entitled to seek maintenance under this Act. (II) Muslim Law: Children have a duty to maintain their aged parents even under the Muslim law. According to Mulla : (a) Children in easy circumstances are bound to maintain their poor parents, although the latter may be able to earn something for themselves. (b) A son though in strained circumstances is bound to maintain his mother, if the mother is poor, though she may not be infirm. (c) A son, who though poor, is earning something, is bound to support his father who earns nothing. According to Tyabji, parents and grandparents in indigent circumstances are entitled, under Hanafi law, to maintenance from their children and grandchildren who have the means, even if they are able to earn their livelihood. Both sons and daughters have a duty to maintain their parents under the Muslim law. The obligation, however, is dependent on their having the means to do so. (III) Christian And Parsi Law: The Christians and Parsis have no personal laws providing for maintenance for the parents. Parents who wish to seek maintenance have to apply under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. (III) Under The Code of Criminal Procedure: Prior to 1973, there was no provision for maintenance of parents under the code. The Law Commission, however, was not in favour of making such provision. According to its report: The Cr.P.C is not the proper place for such a provision. There will be considerably difficulty in the amount of maintenance awarded to parents apportioning amongst the children in a summary proceeding of this type. It is desirable to leave this matter for adjudication by civil courts. The provision, however, was introduced for the first time in Sec. 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1973. It is also essential that the parent establishes that the other party has sufficient means and has neglected or refused to maintain his, i.e., the parent, who is unable to maintain himself. It is important to note that Cr.P.C 1973, is a secular law and governs persons belonging to all religions and communities. Daughters, including married daughters, also have a duty to maintain their parents. (IV) Governmental Protections: 1. The Government of India approved the National Policy for Older Persons on January 13, 1999 in order to accelerate welfare measures and empowering the elderly in ways beneficial for them. This policy included the following major steps : Setting up of a pension fund for ensuring security for those persons who have been serving in the unorganized sector, Construction of old age homes and day care centers for every 3-4 districts, Establishment of resource centers and re-employment bureaus for people above 60 years, Concessional rail/air fares for travel within and between cities, i.e.,30% discount in train and 50% in Indian Airlines. Enacting legislation for ensuring compulsory geriatric care in all the public hospitals. 2. The Ministry of Justice and Empowerment has announced regarding the setting up of a National Council for Older Person, called agewell Foundation. It will seek opinion of aged on measures to make life easier for them. 3. Attempts to sensitise school children to live and work with the elderly. Setting up of a round the clock help line and discouraging social ostracism of the older persons are being taken up. 4. The government policy encourages a prompt settlement of pension, provident fund (PF), gratuity, etc. in order to save the superannuated persons from any hardships. It also encourages to make the taxation policies elder sensitive. 5. The policy also accords high priority to their health care needs. 6. According to Sec.88-B, 88-D and 88-DDB of Income Tax Act there are discount in tax for the elderly persons. 7. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has also been providing several scheme for the benefit of aged persons, i.e., Jeevan Dhara Yojana, Jeevan Akshay Yojana, Senior Citizen Unit Yojana, Medical Insurance Yojana. 8. Former Prime Minister A.B.Bajpai was also launch \u2018Annapurana Yojana\u2019 for the benefit of aged persons. Under this yojana unattended aged persons are being given 10 kg food for every month. 9. It is proposed to allot 10 percent of the houses constructed under government schemes for the urban and rural lower income segments to the older persons on easy loan. The policy mentions: The layout of the housing colonies will respond to the needs and life styles of the elderly so that there is no physical barriers to their mobility; they are allotted ground floor; and their social interaction with older society members exists. Despite all these attempts, there is need to impress upon the elderly about the need to adjust to the changing circumstances in life and try to live harmoniously with the younger generation as for as possible. It may be pointed out that recently the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that the benefits conferred on a Government employee, who is disabled during his/her service period, under Section 47 of Persons with Disabilities (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) Act, 1995 cannot be confined only seven types of medical conditions defined as \u2018disability\u2019 in the Act. The seven medical conditions are blindness, low vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impaired, locomotor disability, mental retardation and mental illness. A Division Bench comprising Justice F.M.Ibrahim and Justice K.Venkataraman said : \u201cWe feel that the court cannot shut its eyes if a person knocks at its doors claiming relief under the Act. In a welfare State like India, the benefits of benevolent legislation cannot be denied on the ground of mere hyper technicalities. It may be noted that this Act is not directly related to aged person but seven medical conditions which prescribed in this Act are the common symptom of the aged person. Need For A Change In Approach: In the older times, after the completion of 50 years of life, one had to detach oneself from the responsibilities of a \u2018Grihastha\u2019 and switch over to the third stage of human life which was known as \u2018Vanpristha\u2019 which referred to the devotion of the next 25 years of life by the \u2018Vanpristhi\u2019 by mana, vachana and karma to the selfless service of the suffering humanity and the larger society in return to the services received form society during the first 50 years of life. Certain strategies and approaches at different levels of policy making, planning and programming etc. will have to be adopted in order to harness this vast human resource for promoting the involvement and participation of senior citizens in socio-economic development process on a much larger scale. This participation must result in an end to their social isolation ad an increase in their general satisfaction with their life. Any attempt to secure the help of the elderly in offering their service to the nation must simultaneously ensure some sort of package of services aimed at arranging for them a better quality of life and a well-designed social security network for the senior citizen. The society and the state in India need to accept the challenge of their effectively focusing their attention on the following twin issues of: (i) How to provide a fair-deal to the senior citizens so that they are able to peacefully, constructively and satisfactorily pass their lives; and (ii) How to utilize the vast treasure of knowledge and rich life experience of the older people so that they are able to utilize their remaining energies and contribute to the all round development of their nation. Palliative Care: Need of the hour : According to a pilot survey, 70% of city\u2019s elderly population is undergoing some kind of medication. The average spending per day ranges between Rs. 3 to 200. However, nearly half of the money goes waste. The reason is absence of proper palliative care in the country. World Health Organization has marked October 7 as a day to create awareness about the importance and need for hospice and palliative care. \u201cAccess to the best quality care, while facing terminal illness is a human right. Ironically, many people in the world are denied this right. The bitter side is that government in many countries does not even realize the important of this right\u201d said geriatric physician Dr. Abhishek Shukla. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 THE ACT WILL be enforced by the State government concerned. The date on which the Act will come into force will be notified by the State government concerned in the Official Gazette. Under Clause 5(1) of the Bill, a senior citizen or a parent may apply for maintenance under Clause 4 of the bill. (A senior citizen is an Indian citizen who is at least 60 years old. A parent could be father or mother, whether biological, adoptive or step father or step mother, whether or not the father or the mother is a senior citizen). If the senior citizen or parent is incapable, any other person or a voluntary organization authorized by the senior citizen or parent can apply for maintenance on their behalf. The Tribunal may take cognizance suo motu (that is, it can act on its own cognizance). These two provisions are welcome since most senior citizens or parents do not have the energy (they do not have the money anyway) to apply for maintenance. The said Tribunal may, when a proceeding regarding monthly allowance for the maintenance under this section is pending, order such children or relative to pay a monthly allowance for the interim maintenance of the senior citizen including parent. The State government is required to constitute within a period of 6 months from the date of commencement of the law (Act), Tribunals for the purpose of adjudicating and deciding upon the order for maintenance under Clause 5. According to Clause 4(1), the senior citizen including parent is entitled to apply for maintenance under Clause 5 if he is unable to maintain himself from his own earnings or out of the property owned by him. A parent or grand-parent can make an application for maintenance against one or more of his children who are majors (\u2018children\u2019 includes son, daughter, grandson and grand-daughter). The obligation of the children to maintain his or her parent extends to the needs of such parent either father or mother or both, as the case may be, so that such parent may lead a normal life. A childless senior citizen, on the other hand, can make an application against his relative (\"relative\" means any legal heir of the childless senior citizen who is a major and is in possession of or would inherit the property after the childless senior citizen\u2019s death; property means property of any kind, whether movable or immovable, ancestral or self-acquired, tangible or intangible and includes rights or interests in such property). Thus Clause 4 makes a reference to grand-parent while Clause 5 does not. In other words, Clause 5 is silent about how the application for maintenance should be made by a grand-parent (who is not yet 60) under Clause 4. I wish the learned law-makers took notice of this inconsistency lest vested interests should exploit this well-intended provision. If the senior citizen has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition that the relative shall provide the basic amenities and basic physical needs to the senior citizen and such relative refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, Clause 23 (1) says the said transfer of property shall be declared void by the Tribunal, if the senior citizen so desires. This is a welcome provision since it protects na\u00efve senior citizens from exploitation by relatives who intend to renege on their promise subsequently. The State government is also required to prescribe a comprehensive action plan for protecting the life and property of senior citizens. This is also a welcome provision since the vulnerable senior citizen can be easily harmed or hurt. In fact the senior citizen may be even carted away somewhere to ensure that none else including the voluntary organization and the Tribunal come to know of their whereabouts. Fortunately Clause 24 of the Bill takes care of this aspect. According to this Clause, \u2018Whoever, having the care or protection of senior citizen leaves, such senior citizen in any place with the intention of wholly abandoning such senior citizen, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months or fine which may extend to five thousands rupees or with both\u2019. I suggest registration of senior citizens with the jurisdictional police station be mandated. The NGO concerned may be requested to visit senior citizens at least every quarter under intimation to the jurisdictional police station. Obviously, the Bill, in its present form, will meet the needs of only parents and senior citizens from educated families, propertied classes and the urban areas. It cannot cater to the needs of parents and senior citizens belonging to the poorer sections of society or hailing from villages. One may find three generations living in the same village and at times even under the same roof! If the son is also indigent, how can he maintain his parent and grand parent? How would the Tribunal adjudicate such disputes? The son will be only too happy if he is put behind bars because he is at least assured of two square meals a day. Understandably, given its limited resources, one cannot expect the government to do a thorough job here. But it can at least ameliorate the situation. How? It should allow income tax sops to those who take care of parents / grand-parents / senior citizens. This is only fair because if tax is collected from citizens, they should be provided social security by the government when they grow old. When the government is not able to provide social security, it should at least encourage the citizens to provide it by allowing income tax sops. After all, a citizen taking care of his aged parents or senior citizens is providing them social security which strictly speaking the government should have provided. Our government taxes individuals a la the US government but unlike the US government does not provide social security to all citizens. I have pointed out this anomaly in my article, \u201cWhy Tirupur has raced ahead of Ludhiana?\u201d dated, Nov 20, 2007. All that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul. It is also unfortunate that the government has not made any serious attempt to cover the senior citizens under \u201cGroup Health Insurance Scheme\u201d. It believes that insurance coverage is mostly required in critical illness and at places where adequately-equipped hospitals are not available (!). Well, for a start, let the government convince me that AIIMS, New Delhi, is adequately equipped to treat indigent senior citizens. The Bill does not cover old age pension perhaps because State governments are implementing the Old Age Pension Scheme. But the amount of pension and the eligibility criteria are not uniform across the States, under the said Scheme. The Bill should have mandated the State governments to pay old age pension to the senior citizens adequately and uniformly across the country. This should not be difficult because all that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul. It has to deny income tax sops to those who do not maintain parents / grand parents / relatives; it has to deny old age pension to those parents / grand parents / relatives who are being maintained by their children / relatives. Lastly, the government, while drafting Bills, uses the word \u2018may\u2019 (instead of the word \u2018shall\u2019) even where provisions of a mandatory nature are involved. What leads to this howler? Is it ignorance or lack of conviction on the part of the government? Note: Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Meira Kumar tabled the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 in the Lok Sabha. The Bill proposes to make it obligatory on the persons who inherit the property of their aged relatives to maintain them. It also aims to make provisions for setting up old age homes to take care of indigent older persons. It aims to set up an appropriate mechanism for need-based maintenance to parents and senior citizens, better medical facilities and old age homes in every district. It seeks for institutionalisation of a suitable mechanism for the protection of the life and property of older persons. Describing ageing as a major challenge and the need to give more attention to the care and protection of the older person, the statement of objects and reasons said many older persons, particularly widowed women, are now forced to spend their twilight years all alone and face emotional neglect and lack physical and financial support. Though the parents can claim maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the procedure is both time- consuming as well as expensive. Hence, there is need to have simple, inexpensive and speedy provisions to claim maintenance, the statement said. A critique of the Maintenance of Parents Bill 2007 On May 8, 2007, the Indian Express carried a critique of the UPA government's Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill 2007, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in March. M. R. Madhavan, who works with the PRS Legislative Research at the Centre for Policy Research focuses on larger policy problems with the Bill, while also zeroing in on specific provisions that arouse his concern: \"The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007, which was introduced in Lok Sabha in March, aims \u201cto provide for more effective provisions for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens guaranteed and recognised under the Constitution and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\u201d While it is difficult to contest the objective of ensuring a comfortable life for senior citizens, a number of provisions in the Bill may not be easy to implement. The Bill neatly sidesteps the directive in the Constitution (Article 41), which directs the state to provide public assistance in cases of old age. The Bill does state that, \u201cThe state government may establish and maintain such number of old age homes at accessible places, as it may deem necessary, in a phased manner, beginning with at least one in each district to accommodate in such homes a minimum of one hundred fifty senior citizens who are indigent\u201d. Note the use of \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d \u2014 there is no obligation on the state governments to establish these. Even without this clause, there was never any prohibition on them from providing old age homes. Also, one wonders why a Bill should specify details such as the minimum size of an old age home. Instead, the Bill places the obligation of maintaining a senior citizen on his or her children, grandchildren or any legal heirs. The process and amount differs from the existing provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Section 125), under which a first class magistrate may order a person to provide a monthly maintenance to his parents (or wife, including divorced wife or children), limited to Rs 500. The Bill provides that the children of a senior citizen have the obligation to maintain a senior citizen to the extent that he \u201cmay lead a normal life\u201d. In case of a childless senior citizen, the obligation is on a relative who is in possession of the senior citizen\u2019s property or who would inherit his property. The maximum monthly allowance is to be specified by state governments, subject to a limit of Rs 10,000. VSome of the definitions in the Bill are confusing. Senior citizens are defined as \u201cany person being a citizen of India, who has attained the age of sixty years or above and includes parent whether or not a senior citizen\u201d. This implies that every parent, including those below sixty years of age, would be considered a \u201csenior citizen\u201d. Relative \u201cmeans any legal heir of the childless senior citizen who is not a minor and is in possession of or would inherit his property after his death.\u201d How does one determine who would inherit the property? Does this mean that the senior citizen has to reveal the contents of his will, and does not have the freedom to change it later? If he is allowed to change his will, consider the case of the person who is initially named in the will, forced to provide a maintenance, and who finds on the death of the senior citizen that there is another will that disinherits him. So what does a senior citizen do if he wants maintenance? He applies to the \u2018Maintenance Tribunal\u2019. The application may also be made by any other person or organisation authorized by him. However, the Bill clarifies that such an \u201corganisation\u201d means \u201cany voluntary organisation registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, or any other law for the time being in force\u201d. It seems to ignore the fact that the Societies Registration Act does not define \u201cvoluntary organisation\u201d. One might be tempted to believe that the purpose of permitting such organisations is to assist a senior citizen. However, the Bill makes it clear that \u201cno party to a proceeding before a tribunal or appellate tribunal shall be represented by a legal practitioner\u201d. That is, one may not use the services of a legally qualified person in obtaining one\u2019s legal entitlements under this law. Regarding the maintenance tribunal, the Bill states that \u201cthe state government may... constitute for each sub-division one or more tribunals... The tribunal shall be presided over by an officer not below the rank of sub-divisional officer of a state\u201d. There are two points to note here. First, the use of \u201cmay\u201d, leaving the state governments the option of not forming such tribunals. Second, the job is entrusted to the SDO, who has a number of other responsibilities. To conclude, one is not arguing against the idea of providing a safety net for senior citizens. The point is that any law that provides for such a net should be implement able. Other than the various loopholes discussed, the big issue is whether parents would take their children to the tribunal, given various social pressures. A better approach may be to design a social security system, including financial products such as pension schemes and reverse mortgages that enable the elderly to live a dignified life.\" This is a powerful critique of the Bill, which is scheduled to be debated during the current session of Parliament. To my mind, there is only one existing precedent for such a law, which is the Singaporean Maintenance of Parents Act. Significantly, that law is backed by governmental programmes of pension, healthcare and other forms of support for the elderly, which adds weight to Madhavan's core argument. Hopefully, these issues will be aired during the Parliamentary debates on this law.",

As per the UNESCO estimates, \n\nthe number of the aged(60+) is likely to 590 million in 2005. The figure will double by 2025. By 2025, the \n\nworld will have more elderly than young people and cross two billion mark by 2050. In India also, the \n\npopulation of elder persons has increased form nearly 2 crores in 1951 to 7.2 crores in 2001. In other \n\nwords about 8% of the total population is above 60 years. The figure will cross 18 % mark by 2025. Problems of The Aged Problems of the aged as follows: Economic problems, include such problems as loss of employment, income deficiency and economic\n\ninsecurity. Physical and physiological problems, include health and medical problems, nutritional deficiency, and\n\nthe problem of adequate housing etc. Psycho-social problem which cover problems related with their psychological and social\n\nmaladjustment as well as the problem of elder abuse etc. International Efforts The question of ageing was first debated at the United Nations in 1948 at the initiative of Argentina. The \n\nissue was again raised by Malta in 1969. In 1971 the General Assembly asked the Secretary-General to \n\nprepare a comprehensive report on the elderly and to suggest guideline for the national and \n\ninternational action. In 1978, Assembly decided to hold a World Conference on the Ageing. Accordingly, \n\nthe World Assembly on Ageing was held in Vienna from July 26 to August 6, 1982 wherein an \n\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted. The overall goal of the Plan was to strengthen the \n\nability of individual countries to deal effectively with the ageing in their population, keeping in mind the \n\nspecial concerns and needs of the elderly. The Plan attempted to promote understanding of the social, \n\neconomic and cultural implications of ageing and of related humanitarian and developed issues. The \n\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing was adopted by the General Assembly in 1982 and the Assembly \n\nin subsequent years called on governments to continue to implement its principles and \n\nrecommendations. The Assembly urged the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to ensure that \n\nfollow-up action to the Plan is carried out effectively. In 1992, the U.N.General Assembly adopted the proclamation to observe the year 1999 as he\n\nInternational Year of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly has declared \u201cIst October\u201d as the International Day for the Elderly, later\n\nrechristened as the International Day of the Older Persons. The U.N.General Assembly on December 16, 1991 adopted 18 principles which are organized into 5\n\nclusters, namely-independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment, and dignity of the older persons. These principles provide a broad framework for action on ageing. Some of the Principles are as follows Older Persons should have the opportunity to work and determine when to leave the work force. Older Persons should remain integrated in society and participate actively in the formulation of\n\npolicies which effect their well-being. Older Persons should have access to health care to help them maintain the optimum level of\n\nphysical, mental and emotional well-being. Older Persons should be able to pursue opportunities for the full development of their potential and\n\nhave access to educational, cultural, spiritual and recreational resources of society. Older Persons should be able to live in dignity and security and should be free from exploitation and\n\nmental and physical abuse. National Efforts (I) Constitutional Protection: Art. 41 : Right to work, to education and to public assistance in certain cases : The State shall, within the \n\nlimits of economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to \n\neducation and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in \n\nother cases of undeserved want. Art. 46 : Promotion of educational and economic interests of \u2026\u2026. and other weaker sections : The State \n\nshall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the \n\npeople\u2026..and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. However, these provision are included in the Chapter IV i.e., Directive Principles of the Indian \n\nConstitution. The Directive Principles, as stated in Article 37, are not enforceable by any court of law. \n\nBut Directive Principles impose positive obligations on the state, i.e., what it should do. The Directive \n\nPrinciples have been declared to be fundamental in the governance of the country and the state has \n\nbeen placed under an obligation to apply them in making laws. The courts however cannot enforce a \n\nDirective Principle as it does not create any justiciable right in favour of any individual. It is most \n\nunfortunate that state has not made even a single Act which are directly related to the elderly persons. (II) Legal Protections: Under Personal Laws: The moral duty to maintain parents is recognized by all people. However, so far as law is concerned, the \n\nposition and extent of such liability varies from community to community. (I) Hindus Laws: Amongst the Hindus, the obligation of sons to maintain their aged parents, who were not able to \n\nmaintain themselves out of their own earning and property, was recognized even in early texts. And this \n\nobligation was not dependent upon, or in any way qualified, by a reference to the possession of family \n\nproperty. It was a personal legal obligation enforceable by the sovereign or the state. The statutory \n\nprovision for maintenance of parents under Hindu personal law is contained in Sec 20 of the Hindu \n\nAdoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. This Act is the first personal law statute in India, which imposes \n\nan obligation on the children to maintain their parents. As is evident from the wording of the section, \n\nthe obligation to maintain parents is not confined to sons only, and daughters also have an equal duty \n\ntowards parents. It is important to note that only those parents who are financially unable to maintain \n\nthemselves from any source, are entitled to seek maintenance under this Act. (II) Muslim Law: Children have a duty to maintain their aged parents even under the Muslim law. According to Mulla : (a) Children in easy circumstances are bound to maintain their poor parents, although the latter may be \n\nable to earn something for themselves. (b) A son though in strained circumstances is bound to maintain his mother, if the mother is poor, \n\nthough she may not be infirm. (c) A son, who though poor, is earning something, is bound to support his father who earns nothing.\n\nAccording to Tyabji, parents and grandparents in indigent circumstances are entitled, under Hanafi law, \n\nto maintenance from their children and grandchildren who have the means, even if they are able to earn \n\ntheir livelihood. Both sons and daughters have a duty to maintain their parents under the Muslim law. \n\nThe obligation, however, is dependent on their having the means to do so. (III) Christian And Parsi Law: The Christians and Parsis have no personal laws providing for maintenance for the parents. Parents who\n\nwish to seek maintenance have to apply under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. (III) Under The Code of Criminal Procedure: Prior to 1973, there was no provision for maintenance of parents under the code. The Law Commission, \n\nhowever, was not in favour of making such provision. According to its report: The Cr.P.C is not the proper place for such a provision. There will be considerably difficulty in the \n\namount of maintenance awarded to parents apportioning amongst the children in a summary \n\nproceeding of this type. It is desirable to leave this matter for adjudication by civil courts. The provision, however, was introduced for the first time in Sec. 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure \n\nin 1973. It is also essential that the parent establishes that the other party has sufficient means and has \n\nneglected or refused to maintain his, i.e., the parent, who is unable to maintain himself. It is important \n\nto note that Cr.P.C 1973, is a secular law and governs persons belonging to all religions and \n\ncommunities. Daughters, including married daughters, also have a duty to maintain their parents. (IV) Governmental Protections: 1. The Government of India approved the National Policy for Older Persons on January 13, 1999 in order \n\nto accelerate welfare measures and empowering the elderly in ways beneficial for them. This policy \n\nincluded the following major steps : Setting up of a pension fund for ensuring security for those persons who have been serving in the\n\nunorganized sector, Construction of old age homes and day care centers for every 3-4 districts, Establishment of resource centers and re-employment bureaus for people above 60 years, Concessional rail/air fares for travel within and between cities, i.e.,30% discount in train and 50% in\n\nIndian Airlines. Enacting legislation for ensuring compulsory geriatric care in all the public hospitals. 2. The Ministry of Justice and Empowerment has announced regarding the setting up of a National \n\nCouncil for Older Person, called agewell Foundation. It will seek opinion of aged on measures to make \n\nlife easier for them. 3. Attempts to sensitise school children to live and work with the elderly. Setting up of a round the clock \n\nhelp line and discouraging social ostracism of the older persons are being taken up. 4. The government policy encourages a prompt settlement of pension, provident fund (PF), gratuity, etc. \n\nin order to save the superannuated persons from any hardships. It also encourages to make the taxation \n\npolicies elder sensitive. 5. The policy also accords high priority to their health care needs. 6. According to Sec.88-B, 88-D and 88-DDB of Income Tax Act there are discount in tax for the elderly\n\npersons. 7. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has also been providing several scheme for the benefit of \n\naged persons, i.e., Jeevan Dhara Yojana, Jeevan Akshay Yojana, Senior Citizen Unit Yojana, Medical \n\nInsurance Yojana. 8. Former Prime Minister A.B.Bajpai was also launch \u2018Annapurana Yojana\u2019 for the benefit of aged \n\npersons. Under this yojana unattended aged persons are being given 10 kg food for every month. 9. It is proposed to allot 10 percent of the houses constructed under government schemes for the urban \n\nand rural lower income segments to the older persons on easy loan. The policy mentions: The layout of the housing colonies will respond to the needs and life styles of the elderly so that there is \n\nno physical barriers to their mobility; they are allotted ground floor; and their social interaction with \n\nolder society members exists. Despite all these attempts, there is need to impress upon the elderly about the need to adjust to the \n\nchanging circumstances in life and try to live harmoniously with the younger generation as for as \n\npossible. It may be pointed out that recently the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that the \n\nbenefits conferred on a Government employee, who is disabled during his/her service period, under \n\nSection 47 of Persons with Disabilities (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) \n\nAct, 1995 cannot be confined only seven types of medical conditions defined as \u2018disability\u2019 in the Act. \n\nThe seven medical conditions are blindness, low vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impaired, locomotor \n\ndisability, mental retardation and mental illness. A Division Bench comprising Justice F.M.Ibrahim and \n\nJustice K.Venkataraman said : \u201cWe feel that the court cannot shut its eyes if a person knocks at its doors \n\nclaiming relief under the Act. In a welfare State like India, the benefits of benevolent legislation cannot \n\nbe denied on the ground of mere hyper technicalities. It may be noted that this Act is not directly \n\nrelated to aged person but seven medical conditions which prescribed in this Act are the common \n\nsymptom of the aged person. Need For A Change In Approach: In the older times, after the completion of 50 years of life, one had to detach oneself from the \n\nresponsibilities of a \u2018Grihastha\u2019 and switch over to the third stage of human life which was known as \n\n\u2018Vanpristha\u2019 which referred to the devotion of the next 25 years of life by the \u2018Vanpristhi\u2019 by mana, \n\nvachana and karma to the selfless service of the suffering humanity and the larger society in return to \n\nthe services received form society during the first 50 years of life. Certain strategies and approaches at different levels of policy making, planning and programming etc. \n\nwill have to be adopted in order to harness this vast human resource for promoting the involvement and \n\nparticipation of senior citizens in socio-economic development process on a much larger scale.\n\nThis participation must result in an end to their social isolation ad an increase in their general \n\nsatisfaction with their life. Any attempt to secure the help of the elderly in offering their service to the \n\nnation must simultaneously ensure some sort of package of services aimed at arranging for them a \n\nbetter quality of life and a well-designed social security network for the senior citizen. The society and \n\nthe state in India need to accept the challenge of their effectively focusing their attention on the \n\nfollowing twin issues of: (i) How to provide a fair-deal to the senior citizens so that they are able to peacefully, constructively and \n\nsatisfactorily pass their lives; and (ii) How to utilize the vast treasure of knowledge and rich life experience of the older people so that \n\nthey are able to utilize their remaining energies and contribute to the all round development of their \n\nnation. Palliative Care: Need of the hour : According to a pilot survey, 70% of city\u2019s elderly population is \n\nundergoing some kind of medication. The average spending per day ranges between Rs. 3 to 200. \n\nHowever, nearly half of the money goes waste. The reason is absence of proper palliative care in the \n\ncountry. World Health Organization has marked October 7 as a day to create awareness about the \n\nimportance and need for hospice and palliative care. \u201cAccess to the best quality care, while facing \n\nterminal illness is a human right. Ironically, many people in the world are denied this right. The bitter \n\nside is that government in many countries does not even realize the important of this right\u201d said \n\ngeriatric physician Dr. Abhishek Shukla. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 THE ACT WILL be enforced by the State government concerned. The date on which the Act will come \n\ninto force will be notified by the State government concerned in the Official Gazette. Under Clause 5(1) of the Bill, a senior citizen or a parent may apply for maintenance under Clause 4 of \n\nthe bill. (A senior citizen is an Indian citizen who is at least 60 years old. A parent could be father or \n\nmother, whether biological, adoptive or step father or step mother, whether or not the father or the \n\nmother is a senior citizen). If the senior citizen or parent is incapable, any other person or a voluntary \n\norganization authorized by the senior citizen or parent can apply for maintenance on their behalf. The \n\nTribunal may take cognizance suo motu (that is, it can act on its own cognizance). These two provisions \n\nare welcome since most senior citizens or parents do not have the energy (they do not have the money \n\nanyway) to apply for maintenance. The said Tribunal may, when a proceeding regarding monthly allowance for the maintenance under this \n\nsection is pending, order such children or relative to pay a monthly allowance for the interim \n\nmaintenance of the senior citizen including parent. The State government is required to constitute \n\nwithin a period of 6 months from the date of commencement of the law (Act), Tribunals for the purpose \n\nof adjudicating and deciding upon the order for maintenance under Clause 5. According to Clause 4(1), the senior citizen including parent is entitled to apply for maintenance under \n\nClause 5 if he is unable to maintain himself from his own earnings or out of the property owned by him. \n\nA parent or grand-parent can make an application for maintenance against one or more of his children \n\nwho are majors (\u2018children\u2019 includes son, daughter, grandson and grand-daughter). The obligation of the \n\nchildren to maintain his or her parent extends to the needs of such parent either father or mother or \n\nboth, as the case may be, so that such parent may lead a normal life. A childless senior citizen, on the \n\nother hand, can make an application against his relative (\"relative\" means any legal heir of the childless \n\nsenior citizen who is a major and is in possession of or would inherit the property after the childless \n\nsenior citizen\u2019s death; property means property of any kind, whether movable or immovable, ancestral \n\nor self-acquired, tangible or intangible and includes rights or interests in such property). Thus Clause 4 makes a reference to grand-parent while Clause 5 does not. In other words, Clause 5 is\n\nsilent about how the application for maintenance should be made by a grand-parent (who is not yet 60) \n\nunder Clause 4. I wish the learned law-makers took notice of this inconsistency lest vested interests \n\nshould exploit this well-intended provision. If the senior citizen has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition \n\nthat the relative shall provide the basic amenities and basic physical needs to the senior citizen and such \n\nrelative refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, Clause 23 (1) says the said transfer \n\nof property shall be declared void by the Tribunal, if the senior citizen so desires. This is a welcome \n\nprovision since it protects na\u00efve senior citizens from exploitation by relatives who intend to renege on \n\ntheir promise subsequently. The State government is also required to prescribe a comprehensive action plan for protecting the life \n\nand property of senior citizens. This is also a welcome provision since the vulnerable senior citizen can \n\nbe easily harmed or hurt. In fact the senior citizen may be even carted away somewhere to ensure that \n\nnone else including the voluntary organization and the Tribunal come to know of their whereabouts. \n\nFortunately Clause 24 of the Bill takes care of this aspect. According to this Clause, \u2018Whoever, having the \n\ncare or protection of senior citizen leaves, such senior citizen in any place with the intention of wholly \n\nabandoning such senior citizen, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term \n\nwhich may extend to three months or fine which may extend to five thousands rupees or with both\u2019. I \n\nsuggest registration of senior citizens with the jurisdictional police station be mandated. The NGO \n\nconcerned may be requested to visit senior citizens at least every quarter under intimation to the \n\njurisdictional police station. Obviously, the Bill, in its present form, will meet the needs of only parents and senior citizens from \n\neducated families, propertied classes and the urban areas. It cannot cater to the needs of parents and \n\nsenior citizens belonging to the poorer sections of society or hailing from villages. One may find three \n\ngenerations living in the same village and at times even under the same roof! If the son is also indigent, \n\nhow can he maintain his parent and grand parent? How would the Tribunal adjudicate such disputes? \n\nThe son will be only too happy if he is put behind bars because he is at least assured of two square \n\nmeals a day. Understandably, given its limited resources, one cannot expect the government to do a thorough job \n\nhere. But it can at least ameliorate the situation. How? It should allow income tax sops to those who \n\ntake care of parents / grand-parents / senior citizens. This is only fair because if tax is collected from \n\ncitizens, they should be provided social security by the government when they grow old. When the \n\ngovernment is not able to provide social security, it should at least encourage the citizens to provide it \n\nby allowing income tax sops. After all, a citizen taking care of his aged parents or senior citizens is \n\nproviding them social security which strictly speaking the government should have provided. Our \n\ngovernment taxes individuals a la the US government but unlike the US government does not provide \n\nsocial security to all citizens. I have pointed out this anomaly in my article, \u201cWhy Tirupur has raced \n\nahead of Ludhiana?\u201d dated, Nov 20, 2007. All that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul.\n\nIt is also unfortunate that the government has not made any serious attempt to cover the senior citizens \n\nunder \u201cGroup Health Insurance Scheme\u201d. It believes that insurance coverage is mostly required in \n\ncritical illness and at places where adequately-equipped hospitals are not available (!). Well, for a start, \n\nlet the government convince me that AIIMS, New Delhi, is adequately equipped to treat indigent senior \n\ncitizens. The Bill does not cover old age pension perhaps because State governments are implementing the Old \n\nAge Pension Scheme. But the amount of pension and the eligibility criteria are not uniform across the \n\nStates, under the said Scheme. The Bill should have mandated the State governments to pay old age \n\npension to the senior citizens adequately and uniformly across the country. This should not be difficult \n\nbecause all that the government has to do is rob Peter and pay Paul. It has to deny income tax sops to \n\nthose who do not maintain parents / grand parents / relatives; it has to deny old age pension to those \n\nparents / grand parents / relatives who are being maintained by their children / relatives.\n\nLastly, the government, while drafting Bills, uses the word \u2018may\u2019 (instead of the word \u2018shall\u2019) even where \n\nprovisions of a mandatory nature are involved. What leads to this howler? Is it ignorance or lack of \n\nconviction on the part of the government? Note: Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Meira Kumar tabled the Maintenance and \n\nWelfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007 in the Lok Sabha. The Bill proposes to make it obligatory \n\non the persons who inherit the property of their aged relatives to maintain them. It also aims to make \n\nprovisions for setting up old age homes to take care of indigent older persons. It aims to set up an \n\nappropriate mechanism for need-based maintenance to parents and senior citizens, better medical \n\nfacilities and old age homes in every district. It seeks for institutionalisation of a suitable mechanism for \n\nthe protection of the life and property of older persons. Describing ageing as a major challenge and the \n\nneed to give more attention to the care and protection of the older person, the statement of objects \n\nand reasons said many older persons, particularly widowed women, are now forced to spend their \n\ntwilight years all alone and face emotional neglect and lack physical and financial support. Though the \n\nparents can claim maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the procedure is both time-\n\nconsuming as well as expensive. Hence, there is need to have simple, inexpensive and speedy provisions \n\nto claim maintenance, the statement said. A critique of the Maintenance of Parents Bill 2007 On May 8, 2007, the Indian Express carried a critique of the UPA government's Maintenance and \n\nWelfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill 2007, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in March. M. R. \n\nMadhavan, who works with the PRS Legislative Research at the Centre for Policy Research focuses on \n\nlarger policy problems with the Bill, while also zeroing in on specific provisions that arouse his concern: \"The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Bill, 2007, which was introduced in Lok \n\nSabha in March, aims \u201cto provide for more effective provisions for the maintenance and welfare of \n\nparents and senior citizens guaranteed and recognised under the Constitution and for matters \n\nconnected therewith or incidental thereto.\u201d While it is difficult to contest the objective of ensuring a \n\ncomfortable life for senior citizens, a number of provisions in the Bill may not be easy to implement. The Bill neatly sidesteps the directive in the Constitution (Article 41), which directs the state to provide \n\npublic assistance in cases of old age. The Bill does state that, \u201cThe state government may establish and \n\nmaintain such number of old age homes at accessible places, as it may deem necessary, in a phased \n\nmanner, beginning with at least one in each district to accommodate in such homes a minimum of one \n\nhundred fifty senior citizens who are indigent\u201d. Note the use of \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d \u2014 there is no \n\nobligation on the state governments to establish these. Even without this clause, there was never any \n\nprohibition on them from providing old age homes. Also, one wonders why a Bill should specify details \n\nsuch as the minimum size of an old age home. Instead, the Bill places the obligation of maintaining a senior citizen on his or her children, grandchildren \n\nor any legal heirs. The process and amount differs from the existing provision in the Code of Criminal \n\nProcedure (Section 125), under which a first class magistrate may order a person to provide a monthly \n\nmaintenance to his parents (or wife, including divorced wife or children), limited to Rs 500. The Bill provides that the children of a senior citizen have the obligation to maintain a senior citizen to\n\nthe extent that he \u201cmay lead a normal life\u201d. In case of a childless senior citizen, the obligation is on a \n\nrelative who is in possession of the senior citizen\u2019s property or who would inherit his property. The \n\nmaximum monthly allowance is to be specified by state governments, subject to a limit of Rs 10,000. VSome of the definitions in the Bill are confusing. Senior citizens are defined as \u201cany person being a \n\ncitizen of India, who has attained the age of sixty years or above and includes parent whether or not a \n\nsenior citizen\u201d. This implies that every parent, including those below sixty years of age, would be considered a \u201csenior citizen\u201d. Relative \u201cmeans any legal heir of the childless senior citizen who is not a \n\nminor and is in possession of or would inherit his property after his death.\u201d How does one determine \n\nwho would inherit the property? Does this mean that the senior citizen has to reveal the contents of his \n\nwill, and does not have the freedom to change it later? If he is allowed to change his will, consider the \n\ncase of the person who is initially named in the will, forced to provide a maintenance, and who finds on \n\nthe death of the senior citizen that there is another will that disinherits him. So what does a senior citizen do if he wants maintenance? He applies to the \u2018Maintenance Tribunal\u2019. The \n\napplication may also be made by any other person or organisation authorized by him. However, the Bill \n\nclarifies that such an \u201corganisation\u201d means \u201cany voluntary organisation registered under the Societies \n\nRegistration Act, 1860, or any other law for the time being in force\u201d. It seems to ignore the fact that the \n\nSocieties Registration Act does not define \u201cvoluntary organisation\u201d. One might be tempted to believe that the purpose of permitting such organisations is to assist a senior \n\ncitizen. However, the Bill makes it clear that \u201cno party to a proceeding before a tribunal or appellate \n\ntribunal shall be represented by a legal practitioner\u201d. That is, one may not use the services of a legally \n\nqualified person in obtaining one\u2019s legal entitlements under this law. Regarding the maintenance tribunal, the Bill states that \u201cthe state government may... constitute for \n\neach sub-division one or more tribunals... The tribunal shall be presided over by an officer not below the \n\nrank of sub-divisional officer of a state\u201d. There are two points to note here. First, the use of \u201cmay\u201d, \n\nleaving the state governments the option of not forming such tribunals. Second, the job is entrusted to \n\nthe SDO, who has a number of other responsibilities. To conclude, one is not arguing against the idea of providing a safety net for senior citizens. The point is \n\nthat any law that provides for such a net should be implement able. Other than the various loopholes \n\ndiscussed, the big issue is whether parents would take their children to the tribunal, given various social \n\npressures. A better approach may be to design a social security system, including financial products such \n\nas pension schemes and reverse mortgages that enable the elderly to live a dignified life.\" This is a powerful critique of the Bill, which is scheduled to be debated during the current session of \n\nParliament. To my mind, there is only one existing precedent for such a law, which is the Singaporean \n\nMaintenance of Parents Act. Significantly, that law is backed by governmental programmes of pension, \n\nhealthcare and other forms of support for the elderly, which adds weight to Madhavan's core argument. \n\nHopefully, these issues will be aired during the Parliamentary debates on this law."

        "markdown": "THE SELF-DEFENSE LAW IN CONTEXT WITH THE INDIAN LAWS By: Shivalika Midha, Advocate Self-Defence Law In India People reserve the right to protect themselves when they are assaulted, or they feel at serious risk; this is known as self-defence. Each state has various laws that characterize what self-defence implies. It is the obligation of each State to secure its residents, yet no country, particularly with its huge populace, can stand to guarantee insurance to every single resident. In this manner, the right to self-defence is one that is perceived by each free country on the planet, so people can, in certain cases, go rogue for their well-being. Any demonstration done in self-defence isn\u2019t an offence, and no individual will be sentenced for something very similar. Be that as it may, for a demonstration to be considered as one of self-defence, the peril should be quick and genuine where the casualty has no ideal opportunity to follow the legitimate response of alarming the local police. An individual has the privilege to protect against the assault of an attacker by utilizing such power as might be fundamental. This right isn\u2019t restricted to the safeguard of his body but rather stretches out to that of his family and, conceivably, in the instances of a felonious attack, even to that of one who very his insurance. It is no offence to safeguard oneself or some other from unlawful viciousness causing sensible dread of death or deplorable substantial damage or to utilize power in the execution of an obligation forced by law, given no more noteworthy mischief is delivered than needed. The strategy behind the right is to make or empower an individual to forestall another from submitting an offence. No individual has the legitimate obligation to run from the impending risk rather, it is relied upon and is allowed to him that he can take a plan of action to the utilization of power to turn away the risk. The law doesn\u2019t anticipate that a duty should be withdrawn from the people. Hostile words without going with the danger of quick actual mischief, be that as it may, don\u2019t legitimize the utilization of power in self-defence. The Right to Self-defense Indian Constitution The Law of Self-defense can be followed back to early human advancement, wherein each individual reserved an option to protect his life and property. This right may likewise be known as the Right of Private Defense. History is flourishing with occasions of networks practising their entitlement to protect their property and life. Indeed, it may not be a misrepresentation to state here that the two universal conflicts which history has seen and the continuous contentions among states and between networks in states are cases of the activity of the right by the networks to protect their territory, water, or other regular assets from infringement either by subjective demonstrations of the State or personal stakes in the public arena. The right of Self-defense does not exist against acts which are not offensive. It is available against all assailants, whether sane or insane, competent or incompetent and a person mistaken or otherwise. The right prevails against overt attacks irrespective of their intention and meaning. It exists even though innocent persons are harmed when there is a danger to life or limb, and there is no other alternative to protect the person. The test is whether there is an immediate necessity for Self-defense and, further, whether or not it was immediately necessary for the defendant to adopt that particular course of action. What is Imperfect Self-defense? Sometimes, a person may have a genuine fear of imminent physical harm that is objectively unreasonable. If the person uses force to defend themselves from the perceived threat, the situation is known as \u201cimperfect self-defence.\u201d Imperfect self-defence does not excuse a person from the crime of using violence, but it can lessen the charges and penalties involved. Not every state recognizes imperfect self-defence, however. Some states also consider instances where the person claiming self-defence provoked the attack as imperfect self-defence.\u00a0 Imperfect self-defence is a common law doctrine recognized by some jurisdictions whereby a defendant may mitigate punishment or sentencing imposed for a crime involving the use of deadly force by claiming, as a partial affirmative defence, the honest but unreasonable belief that the actions were necessary to counter an attack. Not all jurisdictions accept imperfect self-defence as a basis to reduce a murder charge. The concept of imperfect self-defence is that, although not all elements of self-defence were proved, extenuating circumstances nonetheless partially excuse the act that caused death. The doctrine of imperfect self-defence has been defined as \u201can intentional killing committed with an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances justified deadly force\u201d. National Self-defense in Context with India\u2019s State Practice India has been involved in several armed conflicts of an interstate nature since its independence in 1947. It has been involved in wars since 1948\u201349 till now with its neighbouring states, particularly Pakistan and China. However, for the purpose of the present chapter, the focus will be on recent military use of force, particularly after the September 11, 2001 incident. The reason behind choosing this timeline is based on the view that the question of the right of self-defence against non-state actors gained prominence mainly after the September 11 incident. Though the discussion around the scope of Article 51 and the right of self-defence existed prior to the September 11 incident, after this incident, discussions shifted towards self-defence against non-state actors operating from another state. It is also important that the UN Security Council adopted resolutions 1368 and 1373 after the September 11 incident. Sporadic incidents of military firing are reported, however, without leading to any war-like situation. There are also instances of the use of force with intensity and reach, which would amount to the use of force in the legal sense. There are two instances of such nature which took place in 2016 and 2019. These two incidents will be evaluated for the purpose of assessing India\u2019s state practice in relation to the right of self-defence against non-state actors. The Surgical Strike of 2016 in India could also be justified as self-defence force used under international law. Self-defense Law in India against Property with case references Under Sections 100 and 103 of the IPC which state that the voluntary causing of death is protected if there is an immediate threat of death, intention of committing rape or kidnapping or gratifying lust or wrongfully confining a person, or if there is robbery, housebreaking, mischief by fire or theft or mischief or trespass to property where death can be apprehended as a consequence. In the case of Jassa Singh v State of Haryana, the Supreme Court held that the right to voluntarily cause death extends only to trespass of houses and not open land with no inhabitants. Sections 101 and 104 state that voluntarily causing death will not be protected unless all provisions of Sections 100 and 103 are present. The right to self-defence extends not only to one\u2019s own body but to protecting the person and property of another, the has interpreted the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In a verdict delivered on March 7, 2019, a Bench of Justices A.M. Sapre and R. Subhash Reddy deals with the right to private defence, enumerated in Sections 96 to 106 of the IPC, while acquitting a Tamil Nadu Forest ranger who shot dead a sandalwood \u201csmuggler\u201d in the Dharmapuri forest area in 1988. The court observed that the right of private defence extends not only to \u201cthe defence of one\u2019s own body against any offence affecting the human body but also to defend the body of any other person. The court explained that the right does not arise if there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities. Nor does it extend to the infliction of more harm than is necessary. Indian Laws Related to Self-defense Killing Section 96 of the states that \u201cnothing is an offence, which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence,\u201d while Section 97 states that \u201cevery person has a right to defend his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body, the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.\u201d This means that no person can be convicted for any harm caused by an act of self-defence against his own life or property or that of another. According to Indian and Common law, there is no requirement that, in the exercise of private defence against the life or property of another, the defendant must have any relationship with the person whom he has saved. IPC Section 96 to 106 of the penal code states the law relating to the right of private defence of persons and property. Judicial view of self-defence or private defence with case laws The protection of life and property is axiomatic in every civilized society, and because it is impossible for the State to do so on every occasion \u2013 as law enforcement officers cannot be omnipresent, the individual is given the right of private defence. The right of private defence legally accords to the individuals the right to take reasonably necessary measures to protect themselves under special circumstances. Case Laws Darshan Singh V. State of Punjab, the Supreme Court laid down Guidelines for the Right of Private Defence for Citizens. It observed that a person could not be expected to act in a cowardly manner when confronted with an imminent threat to life and has every right to kill the aggressor in self-defence. A bench comprising Justices Dalveer Bhandari and Asok Kumar Ganguly, while acquitting a person of murder, said that when enacting Section 96 to 106 of the IPC, the Legislature clearly intended to arouse and encourage the spirit of self-defence amongst the citizens, when faced with grave danger. Yogendra Morarji vs the State of Gujarat, the Supreme Court discussed in detail the extent and the limitations of the right of private defence of the body. One of the aspects emphasized by the court was that there must be no safe or reasonable mode of escape by retreat for the person confronted with an impending peril to life or of grave bodily harm except by inflicting death on the assailant. This aspect has created quite a confusion as it indirectly suggests that one should first try to see the possibility of a retreat rather than defend by using force, which is contrary to the principle that the law does not encourage cowardice on the part of one who is attacked. Nand Kishore Lal V. Emperor, accused who being Sikhs, abducted a Muslim married woman and converted her to Sikhism. Nearly a year after the abduction, the relatives of the woman\u2019s husband came and demanded that she return. The accused refused to comply, and the woman herself expressly stated her unwillingness to rejoin her Muslim husband. Thereupon, the husband\u2019s relatives attempted to take her away by force. It was held that the right of the accused to defend the woman against her assailants extended under this section to the causing of death, and they had, therefore, committed no offence. Conclusion The examination manages Self-defense as appropriate for individuals as well as an approach to guard themselves somehow or another or the other utilizing some power. The power utilized in protection should be not just fundamental to stay away from the assault but additionally sensible, i.e., proportionate to the mischief undermined; the standard is best expressed in the negative structure that the power should not be to such an extent that a sensible man would have viewed it as being messed up with regards to the risk. It has not been chosen whether the special case works to present an exclusion from the common law of offences against the individual. Such safeguards as spikes and canines are legitimate if sensible. Self-protection claims are genuinely normal, and the guidelines about the circumstances in which an individual can safeguard themselves and the measure of power they are permitted to utilize can be confounded. Everything can be simplified with the guidance of a skilful .

        "html": "THE SELF-DEFENSE LAW IN CONTEXT WITH THE INDIAN LAWS By: Shivalika Midha, Advocate Self-Defence Law In India People reserve the right to protect themselves when they are assaulted, or they feel at serious risk; this is known as self-defence. Each state has various laws that characterize what self-defence implies. It is the obligation of each State to secure its residents, yet no country, particularly with its huge populace, can stand to guarantee insurance to every single resident. In this manner, the right to self-defence is one that is perceived by each free country on the planet, so people can, in certain cases, go rogue for their well-being. Any demonstration done in self-defence isn\u2019t an offence, and no individual will be sentenced for something very similar. Be that as it may, for a demonstration to be considered as one of self-defence, the peril should be quick and genuine where the casualty has no ideal opportunity to follow the legitimate response of alarming the local police. An individual has the privilege to protect against the assault of an attacker by utilizing such power as might be fundamental. This right isn\u2019t restricted to the safeguard of his body but rather stretches out to that of his family and, conceivably, in the instances of a felonious attack, even to that of one who very his insurance. It is no offence to safeguard oneself or some other from unlawful viciousness causing sensible dread of death or deplorable substantial damage or to utilize power in the execution of an obligation forced by law, given no more noteworthy mischief is delivered than needed. The strategy behind the right is to make or empower an individual to forestall another from submitting an offence. No individual has the legitimate obligation to run from the impending risk rather, it is relied upon and is allowed to him that he can take a plan of action to the utilization of power to turn away the risk. The law doesn\u2019t anticipate that a duty should be withdrawn from the people. Hostile words without going with the danger of quick actual mischief, be that as it may, don\u2019t legitimize the utilization of power in self-defence. The Right to Self-defense Indian Constitution The Law of Self-defense can be followed back to early human advancement, wherein each individual reserved an option to protect his life and property. This right may likewise be known as the Right of Private Defense. History is flourishing with occasions of networks practising their entitlement to protect their property and life. Indeed, it may not be a misrepresentation to state here that the two universal conflicts which history has seen and the continuous contentions among states and between networks in states are cases of the activity of the right by the networks to protect their territory, water, or other regular assets from infringement either by subjective demonstrations of the State or personal stakes in the public arena. The right of Self-defense does not exist against acts which are not offensive. It is available against all assailants, whether sane or insane, competent or incompetent and a person mistaken or otherwise. The right prevails against overt attacks irrespective of their intention and meaning. It exists even though innocent persons are harmed when there is a danger to life or limb, and there is no other alternative to protect the person. The test is whether there is an immediate necessity for Self-defense and, further, whether or not it was immediately necessary for the defendant to adopt that particular course of action. What is Imperfect Self-defense? Sometimes, a person may have a genuine fear of imminent physical harm that is objectively unreasonable. If the person uses force to defend themselves from the perceived threat, the situation is known as \u201cimperfect self-defence.\u201d Imperfect self-defence does not excuse a person from the crime of using violence, but it can lessen the charges and penalties involved. Not every state recognizes imperfect self-defence, however. Some states also consider instances where the person claiming self-defence provoked the attack as imperfect self-defence.\u00a0 Imperfect self-defence is a common law doctrine recognized by some jurisdictions whereby a defendant may mitigate punishment or sentencing imposed for a crime involving the use of deadly force by claiming, as a partial affirmative defence, the honest but unreasonable belief that the actions were necessary to counter an attack. Not all jurisdictions accept imperfect self-defence as a basis to reduce a murder charge. The concept of imperfect self-defence is that, although not all elements of self-defence were proved, extenuating circumstances nonetheless partially excuse the act that caused death. The doctrine of imperfect self-defence has been defined as \u201can intentional killing committed with an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances justified deadly force\u201d. National Self-defense in Context with India\u2019s State Practice India has been involved in several armed conflicts of an interstate nature since its independence in 1947. It has been involved in wars since 1948\u201349 till now with its neighbouring states, particularly Pakistan and China. However, for the purpose of the present chapter, the focus will be on recent military use of force, particularly after the September 11, 2001 incident. The reason behind choosing this timeline is based on the view that the question of the right of self-defence against non-state actors gained prominence mainly after the September 11 incident. Though the discussion around the scope of Article 51 and the right of self-defence existed prior to the September 11 incident, after this incident, discussions shifted towards self-defence against non-state actors operating from another state. It is also important that the UN Security Council adopted resolutions 1368 and 1373 after the September 11 incident. Sporadic incidents of military firing are reported, however, without leading to any war-like situation. There are also instances of the use of force with intensity and reach, which would amount to the use of force in the legal sense. There are two instances of such nature which took place in 2016 and 2019. These two incidents will be evaluated for the purpose of assessing India\u2019s state practice in relation to the right of self-defence against non-state actors. The Surgical Strike of 2016 in India could also be justified as self-defence force used under international law. Self-defense Law in India against Property with case references Under Sections 100 and 103 of the IPC which state that the voluntary causing of death is protected if there is an immediate threat of death, intention of committing rape or kidnapping or gratifying lust or wrongfully confining a person, or if there is robbery, housebreaking, mischief by fire or theft or mischief or trespass to property where death can be apprehended as a consequence. In the case of Jassa Singh v State of Haryana, the Supreme Court held that the right to voluntarily cause death extends only to trespass of houses and not open land with no inhabitants. Sections 101 and 104 state that voluntarily causing death will not be protected unless all provisions of Sections 100 and 103 are present. The right to self-defence extends not only to one\u2019s own body but to protecting the person and property of another, the has interpreted the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In a verdict delivered on March 7, 2019, a Bench of Justices A.M. Sapre and R. Subhash Reddy deals with the right to private defence, enumerated in Sections 96 to 106 of the IPC, while acquitting a Tamil Nadu Forest ranger who shot dead a sandalwood \u201csmuggler\u201d in the Dharmapuri forest area in 1988. The court observed that the right of private defence extends not only to \u201cthe defence of one\u2019s own body against any offence affecting the human body but also to defend the body of any other person. The court explained that the right does not arise if there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities. Nor does it extend to the infliction of more harm than is necessary. Indian Laws Related to Self-defense Killing Section 96 of the states that \u201cnothing is an offence, which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence,\u201d while Section 97 states that \u201cevery person has a right to defend his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body, the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.\u201d This means that no person can be convicted for any harm caused by an act of self-defence against his own life or property or that of another. According to Indian and Common law, there is no requirement that, in the exercise of private defence against the life or property of another, the defendant must have any relationship with the person whom he has saved. IPC Section 96 to 106 of the penal code states the law relating to the right of private defence of persons and property. Judicial view of self-defence or private defence with case laws The protection of life and property is axiomatic in every civilized society, and because it is impossible for the State to do so on every occasion \u2013 as law enforcement officers cannot be omnipresent, the individual is given the right of private defence. The right of private defence legally accords to the individuals the right to take reasonably necessary measures to protect themselves under special circumstances. Case Laws Darshan Singh V. State of Punjab, the Supreme Court laid down Guidelines for the Right of Private Defence for Citizens. It observed that a person could not be expected to act in a cowardly manner when confronted with an imminent threat to life and has every right to kill the aggressor in self-defence. A bench comprising Justices Dalveer Bhandari and Asok Kumar Ganguly, while acquitting a person of murder, said that when enacting Section 96 to 106 of the IPC, the Legislature clearly intended to arouse and encourage the spirit of self-defence amongst the citizens, when faced with grave danger. Yogendra Morarji vs the State of Gujarat, the Supreme Court discussed in detail the extent and the limitations of the right of private defence of the body. One of the aspects emphasized by the court was that there must be no safe or reasonable mode of escape by retreat for the person confronted with an impending peril to life or of grave bodily harm except by inflicting death on the assailant. This aspect has created quite a confusion as it indirectly suggests that one should first try to see the possibility of a retreat rather than defend by using force, which is contrary to the principle that the law does not encourage cowardice on the part of one who is attacked. Nand Kishore Lal V. Emperor, accused who being Sikhs, abducted a Muslim married woman and converted her to Sikhism. Nearly a year after the abduction, the relatives of the woman\u2019s husband came and demanded that she return. The accused refused to comply, and the woman herself expressly stated her unwillingness to rejoin her Muslim husband. Thereupon, the husband\u2019s relatives attempted to take her away by force. It was held that the right of the accused to defend the woman against her assailants extended under this section to the causing of death, and they had, therefore, committed no offence. Conclusion The examination manages Self-defense as appropriate for individuals as well as an approach to guard themselves somehow or another or the other utilizing some power. The power utilized in protection should be not just fundamental to stay away from the assault but additionally sensible, i.e., proportionate to the mischief undermined; the standard is best expressed in the negative structure that the power should not be to such an extent that a sensible man would have viewed it as being messed up with regards to the risk. It has not been chosen whether the special case works to present an exclusion from the common law of offences against the individual. Such safeguards as spikes and canines are legitimate if sensible. Self-protection claims are genuinely normal, and the guidelines about the circumstances in which an individual can safeguard themselves and the measure of power they are permitted to utilize can be confounded. Everything can be simplified with the guidance of a skilful . In me, there ought to be an exclusion made for something very similar in the law, whichever is most appropriate with the circumstance emerging and furthermore with the offence which is against the individual.

As Jawaharlal Nehru rotes, there is \"an unbroken continuity between the most modern and the most ancient phases of Hindu thought extending ove: three thousand years.\"l The rights of man have been the concern of all civilizations from time immemorial. \"The concept of the rights of man and other fundamental rights was not unknown to the people of earlier periods.\"^ The Babylonian Laws and the Assyrian laws in the Middle East, the \"Dharma\" of the Vedic period in India and the jurisprudence of Lao-Tze and Confucius in China, have championed human rights throughout the history of human civilization. The indian concept perceives the individual, the society and the universe as an organic whole:. Everyone is a child of God and all fellow beings are related to one ano:her and belong to a universal family. In this context, Mahatma Gandhi remarks, \"I do not want to think in terms of the whole world. My patriotism ncludes the good of mankind in general. Therefore my service to India includes the services of humanity.\"3 3.2 Origin and Development of Human Rights in India The Buddhist doctrine of non-violence in deed and thought says Nagendra Singh, \"is a humanitarian doctrine par excellence, dating back to the third century B.C.\"4 Jainism too contained similar doctrines. According to the Gita, \"he who has no ill will to any being, who is friendly and compassionate, who is free froim egoism and self sense and who is even-minded in pain and pleasure and patient\" is dear to God. It aiso says that divinity in hurmans is represented by the virtues of non-violence, truth, freedom from anger, renunciation, aversion to fault-finding. compassion to living beings, freedom from covetousness, gentleness, modesty and steadiness - the qualities that a good human being ought to have. The historical account of ancient Bharat proves beyond doubt that human rights were as mucr manifest in the ancient Hindu and Islamic civilizations as in the European Christian civilizations. Ashoka, the prophet Mohammed and Akbar cannot be excluded from the geneology of human rights. 3.2.1 Ancient Hindu Law of Human Rights Scholars who have spent long time in lucubration on the Hindu \"Dharmasastras\" and the \"Arthasastras\" and other legal treatises of the past have discovered an amazing system, which, interalia, regulates the duties of Kings, judges, subjects and judiciai as well as legal procedures. The central concept is Dharma, the functional focus of which is social order. The message is \"Dharma\" as the supreme value, which binds kings and citizens, men and women. Human rights gain meaning only when there is an independent judiciary to enforce rights. Here, the Dharmasastras are clear and categoric. 7 The independence of the judiciary was one of the outstanding features of the Hindu judicial system. Even during the days of Hindu monarchy, the administration of justice always remained separate from the executive. It was, as a rule, independent both in form and spirit. It was the Hindu judicial system that first realized and recognized the importance of the separation cf the judiciary from the executive and gave this fundamental principle a practical shape and form. The case of Ananthapindika v. Jeta reported in the Vinaya-Pitaka,\u00b0 is a shining illustration of this principle. According to it, a Prince and a private citizen submitted their cases before the law court and the court decided against the Prince. The Prince accepted the decision as a matter of course and as binding on him. The evolution of the principle of separation of the judiciary from the executive was largely the result of the Hindu conception of law as binding on the sovereign. Law in Hindu jurisprudence was above the sovereign. It was the \u201cDharma.\" The laws were then not regarded so much as a product of supreme Parliaments and Legislatures as at present. Certain laws were regarded as above all human authority. Such, for instance, were the natural laws, which no Parliament, however supreme, could abolish. \"The State was not sacerdotal, nor even paternalistic; even the King was subject to the law, as any other citizen and the 'Divine Right' of Kings known to western political science was unknown to india. On the whole, the aim of the ancient Indiar State may be said to have been less to introduce an improved social order, than to act in conformity with the established moral order.\"9 [Duty is not a tyrant, but a symbol of dignity to be discharged with affrmative joy. The realization of this vast perspective is assured in the Dharmasastras by the wonderful scheme or co-ordination of conduct adapted to different conditions, status and situations of life. The scope of dharma takes in its vast sweep human rights as well.\\\n\\\nAs Nagendra Singh remarks:\\\n\\\nThe individual n ancient Inaia existed as a citizen of the State and in that capacity he had both rights and obligations. These rights and duties have largely been expressed in terms of duties (Dharma) - duties to oneself, to one's family. to other fellowrnen, to the society and the world at large\\\n\\\nThe basis of ancient human rights jurisprudence was Dharma - the ideai of ancient Indian legal theory was the establishment cf socio-legai order free from traces of conflicts, exploitations and miseries. Such a law of \"Dharma\" was a model for :he universal legal order.\\\n\\\nThere are many references in the Vedas, which throw light on the existence of human rights in ancient India. The Vedas proclaim liberty of body (Tan), dwelling house (Skridhi), and life (Jibase). In 1367 B.C. Bahmani and Vijayanagar Kings are stated to have entered into an agreement for the humane treatment of prisoners of war and the sparing of lives of the enemy's unarrned subjects.11 Human rights have always occupied a place of paramourit importance in India's rich legacy because India believed in the principle, \"Vashudhaiva-kutumbakam,\"12 i.e. welfare of all. Justice Rama Jois eloquently sums up this legacy thus:\\\n\\\nAccording to Ra;adharma, the King was given the power only to enforce tre law. Dharmasastras did not confer on or recognise any legislative power in the King. This is the most important distincrion between Kingship in india and the concept of Kingstip in the West. But under the Kingship as recognised and e:stablished under the Dnarmasastras, the laws were those laid down by the Dharmasastras themselves. They did not authorise the King to lay down new laws or amerid provisions of the Dharmasastras. On the other hand, Dharmasastras also laid down the laws governing the conduct of the King himself (Rajadharma).'\\\n\\\nLegal literature of the Hindu period owes much to the distinguished law givers of the times as wel! as to the two Epics and the Arthasastra (Kautilya) and Sukranitisara. W/e are not concerned with the legal history of the lndia of those days, which was quite advanced but with the constellation of rights and duties, which constitute human rights. Kautilya's Arthasastra asserts that \"in the happiness of the subjects lies the happiness of the King, and what is beneficial to the subjects is his own benefit.\"14 Kautilya also disapproved of the theory of royal absolutism and subordinated the King also to the law. Similarly, Shantiparva prescribes that a king may be punished if he does not follow the path of the Dharma\\\n\\\nKautilya, the author of the celebrated politica! treatise Arthasastra not only affirmed and elaborated the civil and legal rights first formulated by \"Manu,\" but aiso added a umber of economic rights. He categorically ordained that the King should also provide the orphan, the aged, the infirm, the afflicted and the helpless with maintenance. He shall provide subsistence to the helpless, the expectant mothers and the children they give birth to.15 To quote P.V. Cane In ancient indian thought,\"there were no acts of Parliament guaranteeing services to the people. The public opinion, the views of eminent: writers and the practice of the best Kings created an atmosphere in wnich it was thought that it was imperative for the King representing the State to encourage learning and to give employment to the unemployed.\"16\\\n\\\nIn the Post-Vedic period, the rise of Buddhism and Jainism were certainly a reaction against the: deterioration of the moral order as against the rights of the privileged class. Life was more human and liberal in the Post-Vedic era. After Euddha, Emperor Ashoka protected and secured the most precious of human rights, particularly the right to equality, fraternity, liberty and happiness. Ashoka successfuily established a weifare State and made provisions for securing basic freedoms.\\\n\\\nAshoka, the champion of civil fiberties, allowed ever the forest folk in his domain to enjoy security of life, peace of mind and enjoy their life on par with other people in the society. Torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners were prohibited uncier Ashoka's benign dispensation.\\\n\\\n# 3.2.2 Human Rights in the Islamic Era\\\n\\\nThe downfall of the Rajput administration gave rise to the advent of Muslim rule in India. It wes under Muizz-ud-Din that the first Musim Empire was founded in India. The Muslim invasion of India created a new situation wherein the Muslirn ruiers or Sultans followed a policy of discrimination against the Hindus. So the significance of Muslim rule in India was counter- productive to harmony, justice and equality. M.K. Nawaz is objective enough to qualify his conclusion with the observation that 'Islamic law' at least in its 1raditional interpretation, considers certain human being as more equal than others.17 There was one law for the Muslims (the faithfuis) and another for the Hindus (the Kafirs or the infideis) and as a result the principle of equality was not given much importance.\\\n\\\nThe Muslim conquerors like Mahmud Ghaznavi and others made frontal attacks on ancient Hindu way of life and religion. With the Mughal rulers, especially with Akbar e new era began in the Mughal history of India in the field of human richts as a result of his policy of 'Universa! Reconciliation and Tolerance.' The European travellers who visited Ashoka's empire highly appreciated his zealous regard for rights and justice. His justice-loving traditior was followed by his son Jehangir too. The trend initiated by Akbar camie to be reversed by Aurangzeb, though the Marathas and the Sikhs opposed and fought the fanaticism of Aurangzeb.\\\n\\\n# 3.2.3 Human Rights in British India\\\n\\\nThe modern version of human rights jurisprudence may be said to have taken birth in India at the time of the British rule. When the British ruled India, resistance to fcreign ruie manifested itself in the form of demand for fundamental freedoms and the civil and political rights of the people. Indians were humiliated and discriminated against by the Britishers. The freedom movement and the harsh repressive measures of the British rulers encouraged the fight for civil liberties and fundamental freedoms.\\\n\\\nUnder the British rule, human rights and democracy were suspect and socialism was an anathema. In the Indian cultural history, the British colonial period remains the Indian equivalent of the 'Dark Ages'. Lord Macaulay rejected the ancient Indian legal political system as 'dotages of brahminical suiperstition', and condemned ancient legal heritage and its inner ccre as an \u201cimmense apparatus of cruel absurdities'. 18 Lord Wellesley condemned the Indians as vulgar, ignorant, rude and stupid and Lord Cornwallis described as an axiom that every native of Hindustan is corrupt. The English East India Company debarred Indians from high offices and deprived them of their political, social and economic rights. The impression created in the Indian minds was that their sacred inalienable human rights and vital interests had been ignored, denied, and trampled upon for the sake of England and the English rulers.\\\n\\\nMahatma Gandhi organised the people of India under his leadership and launched his non-violent struggle to achieve selfgovernment and fundamental rights for themselves. Lokmanya Tilak advocated that \"freedom was the birth right of Indians for which they will have to fight.\"19 It was because of the stiff opposition from the peopie of\\\n\\\nIndia that the Charter Act of 1813 was enacted to promote the interest and happiness of the native inhabitants of India. Similarly, the Government of India Act, 1833 was passed to allow the Indians to enjoy some political rights. The proclamation of Queen Victoria on 1si November 1858 contained some principles of state policy, which were similar to fundamental rights in nature.\\\n\\\nThe concrete demand for fundamental rights came logically in the wake of the nationalist movement, which coincided with the birth of the Indian National Congress in 1885. The Constitution of India Bill 1895 known as the \"Home Rule Document\" prepared by the Indian Nationa! Congress paved the way for a constitution guaranteeing everyone of the citizens the basic human righits like freedom of expression, inviolability of one's own house, right to property and equality before law.20\\\n\\\nThe Government of India Act, 1915, in pursuance of the demands for fundamental rights, guaranteed equality of opportunity in public services. A series of resolutions adopted by the National Congress between 1917 and 1919 repeated the demand for civil rights and equality of status with the English.\\\n\\\n# 3.2.4 Motilal Nehru Committee\\\n\\\nIn 1925 the Indian National Congress finalised the draft of Common Wealth of India Bll adopting a 'Declaration of Rights.' The Madras Session of the Congress jield in the year 1927 - demanded incorporation of a \u2018Declaraton of Fundamental Rights' in any future constitutional framework. A committee under Motilal Nehru was appointed by the National Congress to study the fundamental rights. It is interesting to note that the Constitution of the Republic of India, enacted in 1950, incorporated ten of the nineteen rights enumerated in the Motilal Nehru Committee Report, 1928. The rights emphasised by the Motilal Nehru Committee Report?1 were:\\\n\\\na) Personal liberty, inviolabiity of dwelling place and property\\\n\\\nb) Freedom of conscience, and of profession and practice of religion\\\n\\\nc) Expression of opinion and the right to assemble peaceably without arms and to form associations\\\n\\\nd) Free elementary education\\\n\\\ne) Equality for all before the law and rights\\\n\\\nf) Right to the writ of Habeas Corpus\\\n\\\ng) Protection from punishment under ex-post facto laws\\\n\\\nh) Non-discrimination against any person on grounds of religion, caste or creed in the matter of public employment\\\n\\\ni) Equality of right in the matter of access to and use of public roads, welis etc. Freedom of combination and association for the maintenance and impiementation of labour and economic factors\\\n\\\nk) Right to keep and bear arms\\\n\\\n1. Equality of rights to man and woman\\\n\\\nThe Simon Commission, appointed by the British Government in 1927, however, totally rejected the demands voiced by the Nehru Committee reports. In 1930 tne Congress Working Committee gave the clarion call for the attainment of 'Purna Swaraj.' The Karachi Session of the Congress in 1931 adopted a detailed programme of fundamenta! rights. The Government of India Act, 1935 was passed without any bill of rights much to the disappointment of the Indian leaders. It was the Sapru Committee' of 1945 that subsequently stressed the need for a written code of fundamental rights and the Constituent Assembly raised a forceful demand for the inclusion of human rights in the Constitution.\\\n\\\n# 3.2.5 Constituent Assembly and Human Rights\\\n\\\nThe Indian Constitution was framed by the Constituent Assembly of India, which met for the first time: 0n December 9, 1946. The Constitution of India gave primary importance to human rights. To quote Guha, \"The demand for a declaration of fundamental rights arose from four factors.'2\\\n\\\n1. Lack of civil liberty in ndia during the British rule\\\n2. Deplorable social conditions, particularly affecting the untouchables and women\\\n3. Existence of different religious, linguistic, and ethnic groups encouraged and expioited by the Britishers\\\n4. Exploitation of the tenants by the landlords\\\n\\\nThe Constituent Assembly incorporated in the Constitution of India the substance of the rights proclaimed and adopted by the General Assembly in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Further on $10^{t h}$ December 1948, when the Constitution of India was in the making. the General Assembly proclaimed and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which surely nfluenced the framing of India's Constitution. Viewed from the Indian standpoint, human rights have been synthesized, as it were, not as an integrated fabric by the Preambular promises and various Constitutional clause: of the National Charter of 1950.23\\\n\\\n# 3.3 Human Rights and The Indian Constitution\\\n\\\nThe Constitution of the Republic of lndia which came into force on 26th January 1950 with 395 Articles and 8 Schedules, is one of the most elaborate fundamental laws ever adopted. The Preamble to the Constitution declares lndia to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular and Democratic Republic. The term 'democratic' denotes that the Government gets its authority from the will of the people. It gives a feeling that they all are equal \"irrespective of ther race, religion, language, sex and culture.\" The Preamble to the Constitution pledges justice, social, economic and political, liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship, equality of status and of opportunity and fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation to ail its citizens.\\\n\\\n# 3.3.1 India and the Universal Declaration\\\n\\\nIndia was a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A number of fundamental rights guaranteed to the individuais in Part ll of the Indian Constitution are similar to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The following chart makes it very clear.\\\n\\\nTable 3.1 Civil and Political Rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Indian Constitution\\\n\\ \\\n\\\nThe table below shows: that most of the economic, social and cultural rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have been incorporated in part IV of the Indian Constitution.\\\n\\\nTable3.2 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Indian Constitution\\\n\\ \\\n\\\nIn Keshavananda Bherati v. State of Kerala,24 the Supreme Court observed, \"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights may not be a legaly binding instrument bu: it shows how India understood the nature of human rights at the time the Constitution was adopted.\" In the case of Jolly George Varghese v. Bank of Cochin?s the point involved was whether a right incorporated in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is not recognised in tne lndian Constitution, shail be available to the individuals in india. Justice Krishna lyer reiterated dualism and asserted that the positive commitment of the State Parties ignites legislative action at home but does not automatically make the Covenant an enforceable part of the 'Corpus Juris' in India. Thus, aithough the Supreme Court has stated that the Universal Declaration cannot create a binding set of rules and that even international treaties may at best inform judicial institutions and inspire legislative action. Constitutiona! interpretation in India has been strongly influenced by the Declaration. In the judgement given in the Chairman, Railway Board and others v. Mrs. Chandrima Das,26 the Supreme Court observed that the Declaration has the international recognition as the Moral Code of Conduct having been adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The applicability of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and principles thereof may have to be read, if need be, into the domestic jurisprudence. In a number of cases the Declaration has been referred to in the decisions of the Supreme Court and State High Courts.\\\n\\\nIndia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on March 27, 1979. The Optonal Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1989, however, was not ratified by India.\\\n\\\n# The Constitutional and Institutional Framework of Human Rights in India\\\n\\\n# 3.4 Fundamental Rights and Human Rights\\\n\\\nThe judiciaily enforceable fundamentai rights which encompass all seminal civil and political rights and some of the rights of minorities are enshrined in part Ill of the Constitution (Articles 12 to 35). These include the right to equality, the right to freedom, the right against expioitation, the right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and the right to Constitutional remedies.\\\n\\\nFundamental rights ditfer from ordinary rights in the sense that the former are inviolable. No law, ordinance, custom, usage, or administrative order can abridge or take them away. Any law, which is violative of any of the fundamental right, is void. In ADM Jabalpur v. Shukla,?' Justice Beg observed \"the object of making certain general aspects of rights fundamental is to guarantee them against illegal invasion of these rights by executive, legisiat:ve, or judicial organ of the State.\" Earlier, Chief Justice Subba Rao in Golak Nath v. State of Punjab28 had rightly observed, \"Fundamental rights are the modern name for what have been traditionally known as natural rights.\"\\\n\\\nThe Supreme Court of India recognises these fundamental rights as 'Natural Rights' or 'Human Rights'. While referring to the fundamental rights contained in Part Ill of the Constitution, Sikri the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, observed, \"I am unable to hiold these provisions to show that rights are not natural or inalienable rights. As a matter of fact india was a party to the Universal Declaration o\" Rights . . . and that Declaration describes some fundamental rights as inalienable.\" The Chief Justice Patanjali Shastri in State of West Eengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose\" referred to fundamental rights as those great and basic rights, which are recognised and guaranteed as the natu 'al rights inherent in the status of a citizen of a free country.\\\n\\\nArticle 14 of the Indiar: Constitution prociaims the general right of all persons to equality before the law, while Article 15 prohibits the State from discriminating against ary citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, and pronibits any restriction on any citizen's access to any public place, inciuding wells and tanks. Equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of pub:ic employment is guaranteed under Article 16. Article 17 abolishes untouchability and makes its practice an offence punishable under law. Both A.rticles 15 and 16 enabie the State to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, for such castes and tribes as recognized in the Constitution (known as the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) require very special treatment for their advancement. Article 18 abolishes all non-military or non-academic tities.\\\n\\\nThe right to freedom guaranteed to all citizens under Article 19 encompasses the right to freedom of speech and expression, the right to assemble peaceably without arms, the right to form associations or unions, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India, the right of residence, and the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The protection of a person in respect of conviction of offences under A.rticle 20 includes protection against ex post facto criminal laws, the principle of autre fois convict and the right against self-incrimination. Article 21, the core of all fundamental rights provisions in the Indian Constitution, ordains: \"No person shail be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. Article 21A was added to the Constituition by the Eighty Sixth Constitutional\\\n\\\nAmendment Act 2002. Article: 21A proclaims \"the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.\" The rights of a person, arrested and detained by the State authorities, are provided in Article 22. These include the: right to be informed of the grounds of arrest, the right to legal advice and the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest (except where one is arrested under a preventive detention law). The right against exploitation includes prohibition of trafficking in human beings and forced labour (Article 23), and prohibition of employment of children below 14 years of age \"to work in any factory or mine or in any other hazardous employment.\"\\\n\\\nSubject to public order and morality, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practise and propagate religion (Article 25). Every religious denomination or section also has the right to estabtish and maintain religious institutions and manage their religious affairs (Article 26). No one may be compelled to pay any religious taxes (Article 27). The wholly State-funded educational institutions are barred from imparting religious instructions (Article 28).\\\n\\\nThe rights of any section of citizens or a minority to promote its distinct language, script or culture, to have access to State-funded educational institutions (Aricle 29), and to establish and maintain educational institutions of its choice (Article 30) are also guaranteed.\\\n\\\nThe right to Constitutional remedies is essentially the right to move the Supreme Court of India for enforcement of the above rights (Article 32) The Supreme Court is vested with wide Constitutional powers in this regard.\\\n\\\nThey include the power to issue directions, orders or writs for the enforcement of the fundamerital rignts (Article 32(2). State (i.e. provincial) High Courts too have identical powers (Article 226). As laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the rights conferred by part Ill of the Constitution are void (Article 13), the Courts have the power to adjudge the Constitutional validity of all laws. Furthermore, by virtue of Article 141, the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts in India.\\\n\\\nFundamental rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution may be divided, for the sake of ccnvenience, into two categories viz., specified fundamental rights and other fundamental rights (rights not specifically enumerated).\\\n\\\n# 3.4.1 Specified Fundamental Rights\\\n\\\nMany rights enshrined in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have been recognised specially in the Indian Constitution as 'fundamental rights.' They may be referred to as \"Specified\" fundamental rights because they are mentioned in the Constitution by name. The following table shows the different Articies of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Indian Constitution wherein identical rights are stipulated.\\\n\\\nTable 3.3 Different Articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Indian Constitution\\\n\\ \\\n\\\n# 3.4.2 Fundamental Rights for Citizens only\\\n\\\nThe Indian Constitution has ciassified fundamental rights into two categories: 1) Fundamental rights which are available to citizens only; 2) Fundamental rights available to all persons residing within the territory of India for the time being and subjected to its jurisdiction. The first of the category, which is available to the citizens inciudes:\\\n\\\n1. Article 15 relating to prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.\\\n\\\n2. Article 16 relating to equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of public appointment\\\n\\\n3. Article 19 relating to protection of rights a) freedom of speech and expression b) to assemble peaceably and without arms c) to form associations or unions d) to move freely tr roughout the territory of India e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India and f) Article 19(1) (f) relating to the right to own and acquire property was deleted by the Constitution $42^{n d}$ Amendment Act 1978 with effect from 20-06-1979 9) To practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business\\\n\\\n4. Article 29 relating to protection of interests of minorities\\\n\\\n\\\nThe second category of fundamental rights comprise the remaining fundamental rights which use the word 'Person.' In Hans Muller of Nurenburg v. Superintendent Presidency Jail Calcutta? it was laid down in the judgment that Article 19 applies only to citizens. Fundamental rights mentioned in Article 19, whicn contains the right to \"basic freedoms\", are available only to the citizens of the country. The word 'citizen' that occurs in the above Article has not been used in a sense different from that in which it has been used in part ll of the Constitution dealing with citizenship\\\n\\\nIn Anwar v. State of Jammu and Kashmir2 it was held that non-citizens could not claim fundamental rights provided under Article 19.\\\n\\\nIn Chairman Railway Board and others v. Chandrima $D a s^{33}$ the Supreme Court has observed that:\\\n\\\nFundamental rights are available to all the persons of this country and those who are not citizens of this country and who come here as tourists or in any other capacity, are entitled to the protection of their lives in accordance with the Constitutional provisions. They also have a right to life in this country. Thus they also have the right to live with human dignity so long as they are here in India. Article 14 which guarantees equality before law and equal protection of laws within the territory of India is applicable to \"person\" who would also include both the \"citizens\" of this country and non-citizens. In this case, a Bangladeshi national Mrs. Khatoon was gang raped by the Railway employees in a room at the Yatri Niwas of the Howrah Railway Station in West Bengal. The Calcuta High Court allowed compensation of a sum of rupees 10 lakhs to her for having been gang raped. Upholding the decision of the High Court, the Supreme Court held that as a national of another country, she could riot be subjected to a treatment, which was below the dignity, nor could she be subjected to physical violence at the hancs of Governrment employees who outraged her modesty. According to the tone and the tenor of the language used in Ar:icle 21, they are available not only to every citizen of this country but also to a person of another country. The Apex Court also held that since the word 'life' has been used in Article 21 of the Constitution as a basic human right in the same sense as understood in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, there is no reason why it should be given a narrow mearing.\\\n\\\nArticle 39(a) and Article 44 of the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in part IV of the constitution are for the citizens only.\\\n\\\n# 3.4.3 Other Fundamental Rights (Unenumerated Fundamental Rights)\\\n\\\nA number of rights, which are stated in the Covenant, are not laid down in part Ill of the Constitution. The Indian Constitution has specifically enumerated all the fundamental rights. In Birma v. State of Rajasthan?4 it was held tnat \"treaties which are part of international law do not form part of the taw of the land, unless explicitly made so by the legislative authority.\" Further in Shiv Kumar Sharma and others $v$ Union of India?5 the Delhi High Court held that in India treaties do not have the force of law, and consequently obligations arising therefrom will not be enforceable in municipat courts unless backed by legislation. In A.D.M. Jabalpur v. S. Shukla?6 the Supreme Court by a majority of four to one, held that the Constitution of India did not recognise any natural or common law rights other thar that expressly conferred in the Constitution.\\\n\\\nThe attitude of the Supreme Court has changed especially after 1978. The courts on many occasions by accepting the rule of judicial construction have held that regard must be paid to International Conventions and norms for constructing domestic law. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India,37 Justice: Bhagwati in the Special Bench for the Supreme Court observed that:\\\n\\\nThe expression 'personal liberty' in article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights, which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Article 19. No person can be deprivedl of his right to go abroad unless there is a law made by the State prescribing the procedure for so depriving him and the deprivation is effected strictly in accordance with such procedure.\\\n\\\nThe following are the rights contained in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They are available to the citizens of India through judicial decisions, though they are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution.\\\n\\\n1. Right to travel abroad (Article 21)\\\n\\\nThe right to travel abroad is a guaranteed right under Article 12 paragraph (2) of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In Sathwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramanathan, Assistant Passport Officer, New Delhi38 tre Court held that the right to go abroad is part of an individual's personal liberty within the meaning of Article 21.\\\n\\\n2. Right to privacy (Articles 21 and 19 (1) (d))\\\n\\\nThis right is stipulated under Article 17 paragraph (1) of the Covenant on Civil and Politicai Rights. In Kharak Singh $V.$ Stateof Uttar Pradesh39 it was held by the Supreme Court that the 'domicillary visits' is an infringement of the right to privacy and is violative of the citizen's fundamental rights of personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.\\\n\\\n03. Right against solitary confinement\\\n\\\n04. Right to human dignity\\\n\\\n05. Right to free legai aid in a criminal trial\\\n\\\n06. Right to speedy trial\\\n\\\n07. Right against handcuff ng\\\n\\\n08. Right against delayed execution\\\n\\\n09. Right against custodial violence\\\n\\\n10. Right against public hanging\\\n\\\n11. Right to health care or doctor's assistance\\\n\\\n12. Right to shelter\\\n\\\n13. Right to pollution free environment\\\n\\\n14. Freedom of the press\\\n\\\n15. Right to know\\\n\\\n16. Right to compensation\\\n\\\n17. Right to release and rehabilitation of bonded labour\\\n\\\n18. Right of inmates of protection homes\\\n\\\n19. Right of not to be imprisoned for inability to fulfil a contractual obligation. In Jolly George Varghese v. Bank of Cochin40 it was held by the Supreme Court that to cast a person in prison because of his poverty and consequent inability to meet his contractual liability is a violation of Article 21.\\\n\\\n\\\n# 3.4.4 Right to Child Education\\\n\\\nRight to Child Education (Article 21 A) is a new human right, which is included in the Constitution by the Eighty Sixth Constitution Amendment Act, 2002. In order to make the right to free and compulsory education to a child, the Constitution's $83^{r d}$ Amendment Bill 1997 was introduced in Rajya Sabha to insert a new article 21 A in the Constitution. However, the Bill was withdrawn on November 27, 2001. The Constitution $93^{r d}$ Amendment Bill 2001 was introduced and passed by unanimous vote in the Lok Sabha on Novemiber 28, 2001 and the Rajya Sabha on May 14, 2002 with formal amerdments as $86^{t h}$ Constitutional amendment. According to Article 21(A), the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.\\\n\\\nBefore the Constitutional process started for making the right to education a fundamental righit, the Supreme Court in $1.P.$ Unnikrishnan and others v. The State of Andhra Pradesh41 held that every citizen of this country has the right to free education until he completes the age of fourteen years.\\\n\\\n# 3.5 Directive Principles of State Policy and Human Rights (Judicially non-enforceable rights)\\\n\\\nJudicially non-enforceable rights in Part IV of the Constitution are chiefly those of economic and social character. However, Article 37 makes it clear that their judicial non-enforceability does not weaken the duty of the State to apply them in making laws, since they are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the county. Additionally. the innovative jurisprudence of the Supreme Court has now read into Article 21 (the right to life and personal liberty) many of these principles and made them enforceable.4\"\\\n\\\nThe duties of the State encompass securing a social order with justice, social, economic and political, striving to minimize and eliminate all inequalities (Article 38), securing for \"the citizens, men and women equally\" the right to an adequate means of livelihood (Article 39 (a), distribution of ownership and control of community resources to subserve the common good (Article 3s(b)), prevention of concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment (Article 39(c)), securing equal pay for equal work for both men and women (Article 39(d), preventing abuse of labour, including child labour (Article 39(e), ensuring of child development (Article 39(f), ensuring of equal justice and free legal aid (Article 39 A), organisation of village democracies (Article 40), provision of the right to work, education and public assistance in case of unemployment, old age sick.ness and disability (Article 41), provision of humane conditions of work (Article 42), living wage and a decent standard of life (Article 43), securing participation of workers in the management of industries (Article 43A), provision of a uniform civil code for the whole country (Article 44), provision for early child care and education to children beloww the age of six years. The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years (Article 45), promotion of educational and economic interest of the weaker sections of the people and their protection from injustice and all forms of exploitation (Article 46), raising the standard of living. improving the level of nutrition and public health and prohibition of intoxicating drinks and of drugs (Article 47), scientific reorganisation of an mal husbandry and agriculture (Article 48). conservation of environment, forests and wildlife (Article 48A), protection of monuments and things of artistic or historica! importance (Article 19), separation of judiciary from the executive (Article 50) and promotion of international peace and security (Article 51).\\\n\\\n# 3.6 Fundamenta! Duties and Human Rights\\\n\\\nZleven Part IV(A) of the Constitution embodies the Fundamental\\\n\\\nDuties of every Indian citizen (Article 51-A). These are: the duties to\\\n\\\nrespect the Constitution and its institutions, to live by the noble ideals of\\\n\\\nthe freedom struggle, to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, to\\\n\\\ndefend the country. to prornote communal harmony, to renounce\\\n\\\npractices derogatory to the dignity of women, to preserve the cultural\\\n\\\nheritage, to protect and improve the natura! environment, to have\\\n\\\ncompassion for living creatures, to develop the scientific temper, to\\\n\\\nsafeguard public property ancl abjure violence and to strive towards\\\n\\\nexcelience in all spheres of individual and collective activity. The Eightysixth Constitutional Amendment 2002 inserted a new clause (k) in Article 51(A) instructing \"a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or as the case may be, ward between the ages of 6 and 14 years.\"\\\n\\\nIt would appear that parts IHl, IV and IV(a) of the Constitution heavily depend upon the juciciary for their interpretation and application. The various 'reasonable restrictions' clauses in Part lll, Article 21, and the seldom-used Part IV-A have given the judiciary ample scope for the Judicial Review of administrative and legislative action. Indeed, Article 21 has allowed it to act as a catalyst in prodding the State to implement the directive principles in so far as they directly bear upon \u201clife and persona! liberty.\"\\\n\\\n# 3.7 Political Rights and Human Rights\\\n\\\nIndia is the largest representative democracy in the world, based on universal aduit suffrage, providing every Indian of at least eighteen years of age the right to vote. The Constitution provides for direct elections to the House of thie People of the Central Parliament, i.e. the Lok Sabha and the State (Provincial) Legislative Assemblies, once in every five years at the lates1. The members of the State Legislatures do the elections to the Council of States, i.e. Rajya Sabha, which is the upper house of Parliament. The elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies elect the President. Both the Houses of Parliament together elect the: Vice-President.\\\n\\\nThe right to vote, the: right to contest elections, and the conduct of elections are all governed oy the Constitution (Part XV) as well as specia! laws like the Representatiorn of the People Act, 1951. The Constitution provides for an independent Election Commission (Article 324), which has in fact acquited itself quite admirably in the recent elections, both provincial as wel as parliamentary, and set an agenda for clean elections and elimination of the criminal - politician nexus.\\\n\\\n# 3.8 Institutional Framework and Human Rights\\\n\\\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight States and seven Union (centrally administered) territories. The Constitution provides for division of legislative functions between Parliament and the State Legislatures. 97 items are placed under Parliament, 66 items are allocated for State Legislatures and 47 are made subject to coricurrent jurisdiction of both, with the power of Parliament overriding in case of overlapping legislation (Article 246 and the seventh Schedule of the Constitution). Parliament has power to make laws, inter lia, on preventive cetention (Item 9. Union List, and item 3. Concurrent list), offences against laws in respect of any matter in the Union List (Iltem 93), and any rmatter not enumerated in any of the three lists (tem 97 and Articie 248). Public order (item 1). prisons and reformatories (Item 3), relief to the disabled and the unemployed (ltem 9), and industries other than those declared by Parliament to be controlled by the Union (Item 24) are among the items in the State List. The Police is a State subject (ltem 2), whereas deployment of any armed forces of the Union or any other force under the control of the Union is in the Union List (Item 2-A). Criminal law and procedure (Iltems 1 and 2). preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of the State, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of essential supplies and services (Item 3), transfer of prisoners (Item 4), actionable wrongs, civil procedure (ltem 13), economic and social planning (Item 20), labour matters (ltems 22, 23 and 24), education (ltem 25). and factories (ltem 36) are in the Concurrent List. Further, Article 253 empowers parliament to make laws for implementation of any treaty, notwithstanding the above distribution of leaislative powers.\\\n\\\nThe executive power of the Union is invested with the Prime Minister and his 'Cabinet' who are responsible to the Parliament. The executive power of a State is vested with the Chief Minister and his Cabinet who are responsible \"o the State Legislative Assembly. The President of india on the advice of the Prime Minister appoints the Governor, the head of a State. There is a common civil service for the whole of India, whose officers head the Union administration and nonmilitary security forces, and also the State administrations and Police forces. There is mobility between the Union and State senior positions.\\\n\\\nThe judiciary is presided over by the Supreme Court. The State judiciary is under the control of a High Court, which in certain respects enjoys even broader powers than the Supreme Court, although the law declared by the Supreme Court binds it. lIn the scheme of the Constitution, there exists a separation of powers among the legislature, the executive and the judicary. with the judiciary being fiercely independent of the other two, charged with the task of enforcing the constitutional norms, including human rights, and adjudicating upon all inter-individual, inter-institutional disputes.\\\n\\\nTo monitor the implemeritation of the Constitutional objectives for the welfare of the weaker secticns of the nation, the Central Government has appointed a National Commission for Minorities, a National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and a National Commission for Women. The Nationai Human Rights Commission (N.H.R.C.) came into being in 1993 by virtue of the Protection of Human Rights Act. N.H.R.C. has become an agency to reckon with, and has carved out a place for itseif in the mosaic of 1ndian national institutions for implementation of human rights. The freedom of the Press has been monitored chiefly by the Press Council of India since 1979.\\\n\\\n# 3.9 Judiciary and Human Rights\\\n\\\nOf the three organs of Government, the judiciary has become a vanguard of human rights in India. It performs this function mainly by innovative interpretation and application of the human rights provisions of the Constitution. The Supreme: Court of India has in the case Ajay Hasia V. Khalid Mujib43 declared that it has a special responsibility, \"to eniarge the range and meaning of the fundamental rights and to advance the human rights jurisprudence.\"\\\n\\\nAs has already been pointed out the Supreme Court of India and the State High Courts have broad powers under the Constitution to enforce the fundamental rights and they have liberally interpreted these powers. The major contributicns of the judiciary to the human rights jurisprudence have been two-fold: (a) the substantive expansion of the concept of human rights under Article 21 of the Constitution, and (b) the procedural innovation of Public Interest Litigation.\\\n\\\n# 3.9.1 Expansion of Article 21\\\n\\\nArticle 21 reads as follows, protection of life and personal liberty - \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law.\" The expansion of Article 21 of the Constitution has taken place in two respects:\\\n\\\na) The expression \"the procedure established by law\" received a new interpretation not intended by the founding fathers of the Constitution. In 1950, the very first year of the Constitution, the Supreme Court in the case A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras,44 reflecting on the intentions of the Constitution-makers, held that \"procedure established by taw\" only meant that a procedure had to be set by law enacted by a Legislature. This phrase was deliberately used in Artcle 21 in preference to the American \"Due Process\" clause. Tnree decades later, in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India case, the Supreme Court noted that \"the Supreme Court rejected its earlier interpretation and holds that the procedure contemplated under Articie 21 is a right, just and fair procedure, not an arbitrary or oppressive procedure.\"45 The procedure, which is reasonable and fair, must now be in conformity with the test of article 14 - \"in effect it has become a Due Process.\" There is no doubt that the experience of National Emergency (1975-1977) prompted the court to go all out for vindication of human rights. Since then every case of infringement of rights by the Legislature has undergone judicial scrutiny in terms of the new interpretation laid down in the Maneka Gandhi's case. Further, this approach has led to procedural due: process innovations such as the right to claim legal aid for the pocr and the right to expeditious trial.\\\n\\\nb) The judiciary interprets 'the right to life and personal liberty\" to encompass all basic coriditions for a life with dignity and liberty. Such an approach allows it to come down heavily on the system of administration of criminal justice and law enforcement. It also brings into the fold of Article 21 all those directive principles of state policy that are essential for a \"life with dignity.\"\\\n\\\nThus, the judiciary has interpreted \u201cLife\" to include the right to possession of each organ of cne's body and a prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatmerit by Police. In the Francis Coralie Mullin v. The Administrator, Union territory of Delhr\u00b0 case, the Supreme Court held that \"life\" couldn't be restricted to mere animal existence, or physical survival. The right to life mearis the right to live with dignity and all that goes with it \u2014 the basic necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing, shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself.\\\n\\\nMany of the Article 21 cases that came before the High Courts and the Supreme Court often revealed \"a shocking state of affairs and portray a complete lack of concern for human values.\" The Hussainara Khatoon V. Home Secretary, Bihar case:47\\\n\\\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court that though speedy trial is not specifically enumerated as a fundamental right, it is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21, which deals with the \u2018right to life and liberty'. Justice Bhagwati held \"if a person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure which is not 'reasonable', \u201cfair' or 'just', it would fall foul of Article 21. There can, therefore, be no doubt that speedy trial, and by speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial, is an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21. It was also held by the Supreme Court that 'detention in jail for a period longer than what they would have been sentenced for, if convicted, is illegal as being a violation of their fundamental right Lnder Article 21 of the Constitution.\\\n\\\nDeoraj Khatri v. State of Bihar case48 raised the case of Police brutality in which 80 suspected criminals were brutally blinded during Police investigation (Bhagalpur Blinding case). The Supreme Court condemned it as a \"barbaric act and a crime against mankind.\" In Sheela Barse v. The State of Maharashtra case,*9 the Court was confronted with the custodial violence against women and it laid down certain guidelines against torture and ill treatment of women in Police custody and jails.\\\n\\\nThe Supreme Court has also read into Article 21 a right to monetary compensation for deprivations of the right to life and liberty suffered at the hands of the State. This was highlighted in the Rudal Shah v. State of Bihar case.5o The emergence of the right to compensation has nulified one of the reservations made by India in its instrument of accession to the human rights Covenants, which stated that the Indian law did not recognize such a right in the event of right deprivation.\\\n\\\nThe heaith problems of workers in the asbestos industry led the Supreme Court in the case Paramanand Katra v. Union of India to rule that the right to life and liberty under Article 21 also encompasses the right of the workers to heaith ard medical aid.51 The right to life has been held to include the right to receive instant medical aid in case of injury and the right of a child to receive free education up to the age of fourteen.\\\n\\\n# 3.9.2 Public Interest Litigation and Human Rights\\\n\\\nPublic Interest Litigation - an expansion of class action under the common law - is a procedural innovation, which the Indian judiciary has by now fairiy perfected on the basis of a concept borrowed from the United States. The rule of 'locus standr normally dictates that he who approaches the court must prove his legal standing vis-a-vis the claim he seeks to vindicate, usually in terms of a legal right or a legal obligation violated by the defendant/respondent causing thereby some injury or damage to him for which law provides a remedy. On the other hand, the public interest litigation is based on the principle that:\\\n\\\nWe cannot write off the weaker victims of injustices; the court's door when they knock shall open... How can a bonded labourer working in a stone quarry ever know of moving the Supreme Court?, asks Justice Krishna lyer, a redoubtable public interest activist judge of the Supreme Court of the seventies. He explains that pubic interest litigation, chiefly, in the realm of public law assists 'all people concerned with governmental lawlessness, negligence of the administration, environmental pollution, public health, product safety, consumer protection and social exploitation being served by professionals like liawyers and public interest lobbies; working for 'reform of decision-making processes in Government and outside, affecting the public at large'. Public Interest Law offers new chailenges and opportunities for the committed lawyers and social groups to serve the unequal segments of society better. This sensitive development is part of democracy (of the disabled) and of the movement to vindicate social justice through professions for the people. As a result, judges with a vision have new universes to behold, and mansions of people's justice to build.52\\\n\\\nJustice Krishna lyer realises that the public interest litigation is likely to be abused. Hence he advised that the court should prima facie be satisfied that the information laid before it is of such a nature that it calls for examination. By looking at the credentials of the jnformant, the specific nature of the allegation, the gravity or seriousness of the complaint, and any other relevant circumstances should also be derived. It should also use its own wide investigative faculties as appropriate for the situation.53\\\n\\\nEver since the public interest litigation came to be promoted by the Supreme Court, there has been an ongoing debate in the country between its supporters and opponents. In the Sunil Batra v. Union of India case,54 the Supreme Court entertained a letter from Batra, a prisoner, complaining about the treatment meted out to a fellow prisoner in a jail. The letter activated the Court to deal with a wide variety of issues such as solitary confinement in jails, conditions of under-trial prisoners, sexual exploitation, sexual e:xploitation of blind girls in Schools, detention of mentally ill persons, minimum wages, illegal sale of babies, bonded labour, environmental protection, ill-treatment of freshers in Colleges, better roads, land entitlement, conditions of children in children's homes, treatment of inmates of carehomes, conditions of mental hospitals and deaths at alleged Police encounters. As the court opened its doors wide shedding procedure formalism, many of these issues repeatedly came before it as well as many others such as torture of young prisoners, Police brutality like blinding of suspects during investigation, custodial violence against women prisoners, deaths in Police custody, handcuffing of accused persons facing trials and fetters on incarcerated prisoners.\\\n\\\nAs the legal procedure became deformalised, the court evolved new devices to assist it in dealing with public interest litigation, such as special inquiry\u3001 fact-finding commission, scheme remedies and postdecisional monitoring. A nation-wide Legal Aid Scheme came to be established on the initiative of the Supreme Court.55\\\n\\\nIn 1982 the Supreme Court promised to examine a range of relevant issues concerning 1he public interest litigation procedure. An examination of these issues may be useful to streamline the public interest litigation law and practice with a view to discouraging abuses. As Justice Krishna lyer remarks: it is \"too late to burke Pll, but always welcome to reaffirm, and refine, eliminate the entropy and abuse of the process.\"s56 It is quite possiole that the burden of a backlog of cases awaiting adjudication is what worries the Court. But this is never a reason when 'we the People of India demand social justice,' reminds Justice lyer.5?\\\n\\\nThe judiciary should never bite more than it can chew, Justice Sujata Manohar strikes a note of caution in the context of Article 21 of the Constitution. Article 2 embodies a judicially enforceable right. Therefore, it should essentially be a right capable of being protected by a judicial order. A right not capable of such enforcement, if spelled out from Article 21. . . may result in the trivialization of court's pronouncements and may encourage the habit of ignoring them . . . Every human right may not be capable of judicial enforcement.58 It points out the limits and Jimitations of judicial activism.\\\n\\\nTaking into account thie peculiar nature of public interest litigation, the Supreme Court of India in a public interest litigation, D.K. Basu V. State of West Bengal,9 isslied guidelines to be followed in all cases for arrest and detention by the State interrogatory agencies till legal provisions are made on that behalf as preventive measures.\\\n\\\n# The Guidelines are:\\\n\\\n01. The Police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with their designations. The particuiars of such Police personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register.\\\n\\\n02. The Police officer executing the arrest shall prepare a memo at the time of arrest and shall be attested by at least one witness. This may be either a member of the family of the arrested or a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is made.

A person who has been arrested or detained and is being held in custody in a Police Station or interrogation centre or other lockups, shall be entitled to have one friend or relative or other person known to him or having interest in his welfare being informed as soon as possible that he has been arrested and is being detained in a particular place, unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is himself such a friend or a relative of the arrestee.\\\n\\\n04. The time, place of arrest and venue of custody of an arrestee must be notified by the Police when the next friend or reiative of the arrestee lives outside the District or town through the Legal Aid Organisation in the District and the Police Station of the area concerned teiegraphically within 8-12 hours of the arrest.\\\n\\\n05.

These would aprly with equal force to other Government agencies including the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Directorate of Enforcement, Coast Guard, Central Reserve Police Force (C.R.P.F), Border Security Force (B.s.F.) the Central Industrial Security Force (C.1.S.F), the State Armed Police. lritelligence Agencies, such as the Intelligence Bureau, RAW, Central Bureau of Investigation (C.B.l.) and C.l.D. These guidelines are only a few out of a large number of judgements of the apex court in which the court upheld the human rights of the oppressed individuals.\\\n\\\n# 3.10 Media and Human Rights\\\n\\\nThe Information Mecia is an important arm of any modern democratic polity through which the people exercise their freedom of information. The freedom of information, the democratic right to know, is crucial in making all other human rights effective and providing an important safeguard for the enjoyment of all those rights. Traditionally. the vehicle of public irnformation was the Press. Today it is called the media, which include the press, the radio, the television and the internet. The \"Fourth Estate\" plays a crucial role in a large democracy like India where about 1500 different types of newspapers are circulated.\\\n\\\nThe period of National Emergency saw, for the first time, the gagging of the free press. Many then depended on the BBC for 'impartial news about lndia. It is no wonde:r that the freedom of the Press or media became a watchword after eimergency.\\\n\\\nDisposing of a case o' contempt of court against the editors of two newspapers, the Supreme Court remarked:\\\n\\\nIt is the duty of a true and responsible journalist to provide the people with accurate and impartial presentation of news and his views after dispassionate evaluation of facts and information received by him and to be published as a news item. The editor of a newspaper or a journal, the court said, has a greater responsibility to guard against untruthful news and its publication. If the newspaper publishes what is improper, mischievously false or illegal and abuses its liberty, it must e punished by a court of law. While a free and healthy press is indispensable to the functioning of a true democracy, the court said, \"the freedom of the press is subject to reasonable restraints.\"60\\\n\\\nSince the 1970's the media in lndia have played a central role in sensitising people with intormation about governance, development, science and technology, foreigr relations and so on. However, of late it has also come in for criticisn1, as highlighted by the above Supreme Court decision. There has been e decline in journalistic credibility, as noted by the Chairman of the Press Council of India himself in a seminar.'1 Senior journalists feel that the media shies away from important 'people's issues like tribal issues, that it is losing social content and becoming a consumer product with a manager overshadowing the editor.62 While the media is \"a vital leverage to keep the rulers in check,\" it has failed \"to educate people to assert their claim to the right to information,\" observes another senior journalist.63 The press also has come in for rough treatment by terrorists, insurgents, and some individual politicians. The Chairman of the Press Council condemned increasing commercialism and corrupt practices emphasizing the need to arrest them.\"4 The media also has a tendency to launch \"trials by the media,\" even sentencing by the media, even while a court proceeding is underway.\\\n\\\nConsidering the totality of the impact of the media during the past two decades, despite the above pitfalls, one must recognise that the contribution of the media in revealing and highlighting human rights causes has been most impressive. A colonial law relating to official secrecy, the Official Secrets Act, 1923, however, remains an impediment in the effective exercise of the freedom of information.\\\n\\\n3.11 Some other Measures of Protection of Human Rights under\\\n\\\nIndian Law\\\n\\\n01.

This is an elaborate charter on human rights ever framed by any State in the world. Part lll of the Indian Constitution may be characterised as the 'Magna Carta' of India. The Judiciary in India plays a significant role in protecting human rights. The Indian Courts have now become the courts of the poor and the struggling masses and let open their portals to the poor, the ignorant, the illiterates, the downtrodden, the have-nots, the handicapped and the half-hungry, half-naked countrymen.\\\n\\\n# References and Notes\\\n\\\n1 Jawaharlar Nehru, The Discovery of Iindia. $2^{n d}$ ed.

As Jawaharlal Nehru rotes, there is \"an unbroken continuity between the most modern and the most ancient phases of Hindu thought extending ove: three thousand years.\"l The rights of man have been the concern of all civilizations from time immemorial. \"The concept of the rights of man and other fundamental rights was not unknown to the people of earlier periods.\"^ The Babylonian Laws and the Assyrian laws in the Middle East, the \"Dharma\" of the Vedic period in India and the jurisprudence of Lao-Tze and Confucius in China, have championed human rights throughout the history of human civilization. The indian concept perceives the individual, the society and the universe as an organic whole:. Everyone is a child of God and all fellow beings are related to one ano:her and belong to a universal family. In this context, Mahatma Gandhi remarks, \"I do not want to think in terms of the whole world. My patriotism ncludes the good of mankind in general. Therefore my service to India includes the services of humanity.\"3 3.2  Origin and Development of Human Rights in India The Buddhist doctrine of non-violence in deed and thought says Nagendra Singh, \"is a humanitarian doctrine par excellence, dating back to the third century B.C.\"4 Jainism too contained similar doctrines. According to the Gita, \"he who has no ill will to any being, who is friendly and compassionate, who is free froim egoism and self sense and who is even-minded in pain and pleasure and patient\" is dear to God. It aiso says that divinity in hurmans is represented by the virtues of non-violence, truth, freedom from anger, renunciation, aversion to fault-finding. compassion to living beings, freedom from covetousness, gentleness, modesty and steadiness - the qualities that a good human being ought to have.  The historical account of ancient Bharat proves beyond doubt that human rights were as mucr manifest in the ancient Hindu and Islamic civilizations as in the European Christian civilizations. Ashoka, the prophet Mohammed and Akbar cannot be excluded from the geneology of human rights. 3.2.1 Ancient Hindu Law of Human Rights Scholars who have spent long time in lucubration on the Hindu \"Dharmasastras\" and the \"Arthasastras\" and other legal treatises of the past have discovered an amazing system, which, interalia, regulates the duties of Kings, judges, subjects and judiciai as well as legal procedures. The central concept is Dharma, the functional focus of which is social order. The message is \"Dharma\" as the supreme value, which binds kings and citizens, men and women. Human rights gain meaning only when there is an independent judiciary to enforce rights. Here, the Dharmasastras are clear and categoric. 7 The independence of the judiciary was one of the outstanding features of the Hindu judicial system. Even during the days of Hindu monarchy, the administration of justice always remained separate from the executive. It was, as a rule, independent both in form and spirit. It was the Hindu judicial system that first realized and recognized the importance of the separation cf the judiciary from the executive and gave this fundamental principle a practical shape and form. The case of Ananthapindika v. Jeta reported in the Vinaya-Pitaka,\u00b0 is a shining illustration of this principle. According to it, a Prince and a private citizen submitted their  cases before the law  court and the court decided against the Prince. The Prince accepted the decision as a matter of course and as binding on him. The evolution of the principle of separation of the judiciary from the executive was largely the result of the Hindu conception of law as binding on the sovereign. Law in Hindu jurisprudence was above the sovereign. It was the \u201cDharma.\" The laws were then not regarded so much as a product of supreme Parliaments and Legislatures as at present. Certain laws were regarded as above all human authority. Such, for instance, were the natural laws, which no Parliament, however supreme, could abolish. \"The State was not sacerdotal, nor even paternalistic; even the King was subject to the law, as any other citizen and the 'Divine Right' of Kings known to western political science was unknown to india. On the whole, the aim of the ancient Indiar State may be said to have been less to introduce an improved social order, than to act in conformity with the established moral order.\"9 [Duty is not a tyrant, but a symbol of dignity to be discharged with affrmative joy. The realization of this vast perspective is assured in the Dharmasastras by the wonderful scheme or co-ordination of conduct adapted to different conditions, status and situations of life. The scope of dharma takes in its vast sweep human rights as well. As Nagendra Singh remarks: The individual n ancient Inaia existed as a citizen of the State and in that capacity he had both rights and obligations. These rights and duties have largely been expressed in terms of duties (Dharma) - duties to oneself, to one's family. to other fellowrnen, to the society and the world at large The   basis  of  ancient  human  rights  jurisprudence   was Dharma - the ideai of ancient Indian legal theory was the establishment  cf  socio-legai  order  free from  traces  of conflicts, exploitations and miseries. Such a law of \"Dharma\" was a model for :he universal legal order. There are many references in the Vedas, which throw light on the existence of human rights in ancient India. The Vedas proclaim liberty of body (Tan), dwelling house (Skridhi), and life (Jibase). In 1367 B.C. Bahmani and Vijayanagar Kings are stated to have entered into an agreement for the humane treatment of prisoners of war and the sparing of lives of the enemy's unarrned subjects.11 Human rights have always occupied a place of paramourit importance in India's rich legacy because India believed in the principle, \"Vashudhaiva-kutumbakam,\"12 i.e. welfare of all. Justice Rama Jois eloquently sums up this legacy thus: According to Ra;adharma, the King was given the power only to enforce tre law. Dharmasastras did not confer on or recognise any legislative power in the King. This is the most important distincrion between Kingship in india and the concept of Kingstip in the West. But under the Kingship as recognised and e:stablished under the Dnarmasastras, the laws  were   those   laid   down   by  the  Dharmasastras themselves. They did not authorise the King to lay down new laws or amerid provisions of the Dharmasastras. On the other hand, Dharmasastras also laid down the laws governing the conduct of the King himself (Rajadharma).' Legal literature of the Hindu period owes much to the distinguished law givers of the times as wel! as to the two Epics and the Arthasastra (Kautilya) and Sukranitisara. W/e are not concerned with the legal history of the lndia of those days, which was quite advanced but with the constellation of rights and duties, which constitute human rights. Kautilya's Arthasastra asserts that \"in the happiness of the subjects lies the happiness of the King, and what is beneficial to the subjects is his own benefit.\"14 Kautilya also disapproved of the theory of royal absolutism and subordinated the King also to the law. Similarly, Shantiparva prescribes that a king may be punished if he does not follow the path of the Dharma Kautilya, the author of the celebrated politica! treatise Arthasastra not only affirmed and elaborated the civil and legal rights first formulated by \"Manu,\" but aiso added a umber of economic rights. He categorically ordained that the King should also provide the orphan, the aged, the infirm, the afflicted and the helpless with maintenance. He shall provide subsistence to the helpless, the expectant mothers and the children they give birth to.15 To quote P.V. Cane In ancient indian thought,\"there were no acts of Parliament guaranteeing services to the people. The public opinion, the views of eminent: writers and the practice of the best Kings created an atmosphere in wnich it was thought that it was imperative for the King representing the State to encourage learning and to give employment to the unemployed.\"16 In the Post-Vedic period, the rise of Buddhism and Jainism were certainly a reaction against the: deterioration of the moral order as against the rights of the privileged class. Life was more human and liberal in the Post-Vedic era. After Euddha, Emperor Ashoka protected and secured the most precious of human rights, particularly the right to equality, fraternity, liberty and happiness. Ashoka successfuily established a  weifare  State and  made provisions  for  securing basic freedoms. Ashoka, the champion of civil fiberties, allowed ever the forest folk in his domain to enjoy security of life, peace of mind and enjoy their life on par with other people in the society. Torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners were prohibited uncier Ashoka's benign dispensation. 3.2.2 Human Rights in the Islamic Era The downfall of the Rajput administration gave rise to the advent of Muslim rule in India. It wes under Muizz-ud-Din that the first Musim Empire was founded in India. The Muslim invasion of India created a new situation wherein the Muslirn ruiers or Sultans followed a policy of discrimination against the Hindus. So the significance of Muslim rule in India was counter- productive to harmony, justice and equality. M.K. Nawaz is objective enough to qualify his conclusion with the observation that 'Islamic law' at least in its 1raditional interpretation, considers certain human being as more equal than others.17 There was one law for the Muslims (the faithfuis) and another for the Hindus (the Kafirs or the infideis) and as a result the principle of equality was not given much importance. The Muslim conquerors like Mahmud Ghaznavi and others made frontal attacks on ancient Hindu way of life and religion. With the Mughal rulers, especially with Akbar e new era began in the Mughal history of India in the field of human richts as a result of his policy of 'Universa! Reconciliation and Tolerance.' The European travellers who visited Ashoka's empire highly appreciated his zealous regard for rights and justice. His justice-loving traditior was followed by his son Jehangir too. The trend initiated by Akbar camie to be reversed by Aurangzeb, though the Marathas and the Sikhs opposed and fought the fanaticism of Aurangzeb. 3.2.3 Human Rights in British India The modern version of human rights jurisprudence may be said to have taken birth in India at the time of the British rule. When the British ruled India, resistance to fcreign ruie manifested itself in the form of demand for fundamental freedoms and the civil and political rights of the people. Indians were humiliated and discriminated against by the Britishers. The freedom movement and the harsh repressive measures of the British rulers encouraged the fight for civil liberties and fundamental freedoms. Under the British rule, human rights and democracy were suspect and socialism was an anathema. In the Indian cultural history, the British colonial period remains the Indian equivalent of the 'Dark Ages'. Lord Macaulay rejected the ancient Indian legal political system as 'dotages of brahminical suiperstition', and condemned ancient legal heritage and its inner ccre as an \u201cimmense apparatus of cruel absurdities'. 18 Lord Wellesley condemned the Indians as vulgar, ignorant, rude and stupid and Lord Cornwallis described as an axiom that every native of Hindustan is corrupt. The English East India Company debarred Indians from high offices and deprived them of their political, social and economic rights. The impression created in the Indian minds was that their sacred inalienable human rights and vital interests had been ignored, denied, and trampled upon for the sake of England and the English rulers. Mahatma  Gandhi  organised  the  people  of  India  under  his leadership  and  launched  his  non-violent  struggle  to  achieve  selfgovernment and fundamental rights for themselves. Lokmanya Tilak advocated that \"freedom was the birth right of Indians for which they will have to fight.\"19 It was because of the stiff opposition from the peopie of India that the Charter Act of 1813 was enacted to promote the interest and happiness of the native inhabitants of India.  Similarly, the Government of India Act, 1833 was passed to allow the Indians to enjoy some political rights.  The proclamation   of  Queen  Victoria  on 1si November 1858 contained some principles of state policy, which were similar to fundamental rights in nature. The concrete demand for fundamental rights came logically in the wake of the nationalist movement, which coincided with the birth of the Indian National Congress in 1885. The Constitution of India Bill 1895 known as the \"Home Rule Document\" prepared by the Indian Nationa! Congress paved the way for a constitution guaranteeing everyone of the citizens the basic human righits like freedom of expression, inviolability of one's own house, right to property and equality before law.20 The Government of India Act, 1915, in pursuance of the demands for fundamental rights, guaranteed equality of opportunity in public services. A series of resolutions adopted by the National Congress between 1917 and 1919 repeated the demand for civil rights and equality of status with the English. 3.2.4 Motilal Nehru Committee In  1925  the  Indian  National  Congress finalised  the   draft  of Common Wealth of India Bll adopting a 'Declaration of Rights.'  The Madras Session of the Congress jield in the year 1927 - demanded incorporation of a \u2018Declaraton of Fundamental Rights' in any future constitutional framework. A committee under Motilal Nehru was appointed by the National Congress to study the fundamental rights. It is interesting to note that the Constitution of the Republic of India, enacted in 1950, incorporated ten of the nineteen rights enumerated in the Motilal Nehru Committee Report, 1928. The rights emphasised by the Motilal Nehru Committee Report?1 were: a) Personal liberty, inviolabiity of dwelling place and property b) Freedom of conscience, and of profession and practice of religion c) Expression of opinion and the right to assemble peaceably without arms and to form associations d) Free elementary education e) Equality for all before the law and rights f) Right to the writ of Habeas Corpus g) Protection from punishment under ex-post facto laws h) Non-discrimination against any person on grounds of religion, caste or creed in the matter of public employment i) Equality of right in the matter of access to and use of public roads, welis etc. Freedom of combination and association for the maintenance and impiementation of labour and economic factors k) Right to keep and bear arms Equality of rights to man and woman The Simon Commission, appointed by the British Government in 1927, however, totally rejected the demands voiced by the Nehru Committee reports. In 1930 tne Congress Working Committee gave the clarion call for the attainment of 'Purna Swaraj.' The Karachi Session of the Congress in 1931 adopted a detailed programme of fundamenta! rights. The Government of India Act, 1935 was passed without any bill of rights much to the disappointment of the Indian leaders. It was the Sapru Committee' of 1945 that subsequently stressed the need for a written code of fundamental rights and the Constituent Assembly raised a forceful demand for the inclusion of human rights in the Constitution. 3.2.5 Constituent Assembly and Human Rights The Indian Constitution was framed by the Constituent Assembly of India, which met for the first time: 0n December 9, 1946. The Constitution of India gave primary importance to human rights. To quote Guha, \"The demand for a declaration of fundamental rights arose from four factors.'2 Lack of civil liberty in ndia during the British rule Deplorable social conditions, particularly affecting the untouchables and women Existence of different religious, linguistic, and ethnic groups encouraged and expioited by the Britishers Exploitation of the tenants by the landlords The Constituent Assembly incorporated in the Constitution of India the substance of the rights proclaimed and adopted by the General Assembly in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Further on $10^{t h}$ December 1948, when the Constitution of India was in the making. the General Assembly proclaimed and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which surely nfluenced the framing of India's Constitution. Viewed from the Indian standpoint, human rights have been synthesized, as it were, not as an integrated fabric by the Preambular promises and various Constitutional clause: of the National Charter of 1950.23 3.3 Human Rights and The Indian Constitution The Constitution of the Republic of lndia which came into force on 26th January 1950 with 395 Articles and 8 Schedules, is one of the most elaborate fundamental laws ever adopted. The Preamble to the Constitution declares lndia to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular and Democratic Republic. The term 'democratic' denotes that the Government gets its authority from the will of the people. It gives a feeling that they all are equal \"irrespective of ther race, religion, language, sex and culture.\" The Preamble to the Constitution pledges justice, social, economic and political, liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship, equality of status and of opportunity and fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation to ail its citizens. 3.3.1 India and the Universal Declaration India was a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A number of fundamental rights guaranteed to the individuais in Part ll of the Indian Constitution are similar  to the provisions of  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The following chart makes it very clear. Table 3.1 Civil and Political Rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Indian Constitution The table below shows: that most of the economic, social and cultural rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have been incorporated in part IV of the Indian Constitution. Table3.2 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Indian Constitution In Keshavananda Bherati v. State of Kerala,24 the Supreme Court observed, \"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights may not be a legaly binding instrument bu: it shows how India understood the nature of human rights at the time the Constitution was adopted.\" In the case of Jolly George Varghese v. Bank of Cochin?s the point involved was whether a right incorporated in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is not recognised in tne lndian Constitution, shail be available to the individuals in india. Justice Krishna lyer reiterated dualism and asserted that the positive commitment of the State Parties ignites legislative action at home but does not automatically make the Covenant an enforceable part of the 'Corpus Juris' in India. Thus, aithough the Supreme Court has stated that the Universal Declaration cannot create a binding set of rules and that even international treaties may at best inform judicial institutions and inspire legislative action. Constitutiona! interpretation in India has been strongly influenced by the Declaration. In the judgement given in the Chairman, Railway Board and others v. Mrs. Chandrima Das,26 the Supreme Court observed that the Declaration has the international recognition as the Moral Code of Conduct having been adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The applicability of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and principles thereof may have to be read, if need be, into the domestic jurisprudence. In a number of cases the Declaration has been referred to in the decisions of the Supreme Court and State High Courts. India ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on March 27, 1979. The Optonal Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1989, however, was not ratified by India. The Constitutional and Institutional Framework of Human Rights in India 3.4  Fundamental Rights and Human Rights The judiciaily enforceable fundamentai rights which encompass all seminal civil and political rights and some of the rights of minorities are enshrined in part Ill of the Constitution (Articles 12 to 35). These include the right to equality, the right to freedom, the right against expioitation, the right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and the right to Constitutional remedies. Fundamental rights ditfer from ordinary rights in the sense that the former are inviolable. No law, ordinance, custom, usage, or administrative order can abridge or take them away. Any law, which is violative of any of the fundamental right, is void. In ADM Jabalpur v. Shukla,?' Justice Beg observed \"the object of making certain general aspects of rights fundamental is to guarantee them against illegal invasion of these rights by executive, legisiat:ve, or judicial organ of the State.\" Earlier, Chief Justice Subba Rao in Golak Nath v. State of Punjab28 had rightly observed, \"Fundamental rights are the modern name for what have been traditionally known as natural rights.\" The Supreme Court of India recognises these fundamental rights as 'Natural Rights' or 'Human Rights'. While referring to the fundamental rights contained in Part Ill of the Constitution, Sikri the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, observed, \"I am unable to hiold these provisions to show that rights are not natural or inalienable rights. As a matter of fact india was a party to the Universal Declaration o\" Rights . . . and that Declaration describes some fundamental rights as inalienable.\" The Chief Justice Patanjali Shastri in State of West Eengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose\" referred to fundamental rights as those great and basic rights, which are recognised and guaranteed as the natu 'al rights inherent in the status of a citizen of a free country. Article 14 of the Indiar: Constitution prociaims the general right of all persons to equality before the law, while Article 15 prohibits the State from discriminating against ary citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, and pronibits any restriction on any citizen's access to any public place, inciuding wells and tanks. Equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of pub:ic employment is guaranteed under Article 16. Article 17 abolishes untouchability and makes its practice an offence punishable under law. Both A.rticles 15 and 16 enabie the State to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, for such castes and tribes as recognized in the Constitution (known as the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) require very special treatment for their advancement. Article 18 abolishes all non-military or non-academic tities. The right to freedom guaranteed to all citizens under Article 19 encompasses the right to freedom of speech and expression, the right to assemble peaceably without arms, the right to form associations or unions, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India, the right of residence, and the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The protection of a person in respect of conviction of offences under A.rticle 20 includes protection against ex post facto criminal laws, the principle of autre fois convict and the right against self-incrimination. Article 21, the core of all fundamental rights provisions in the Indian Constitution, ordains: \"No person shail be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. Article 21A was added to the Constituition by the Eighty Sixth Constitutional Amendment Act 2002. Article: 21A proclaims \"the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.\" The rights of a person, arrested and detained by the State authorities, are provided in Article 22. These include the: right to be informed of the grounds of arrest, the right to legal advice and the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest (except where one is arrested under a preventive detention law).  The right against exploitation  includes prohibition  of trafficking in human beings and forced labour (Article 23), and prohibition of employment of children below 14 years of age \"to work in any factory or mine or in any other hazardous employment.\" Subject to public order and morality, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practise and propagate religion (Article 25). Every religious denomination or section also has the right to estabtish and maintain religious institutions and manage their religious affairs (Article 26). No one may be compelled to pay any religious taxes (Article 27). The wholly State-funded educational institutions are barred from imparting religious instructions (Article 28). The rights of any section of citizens or a minority to promote its distinct language, script or culture, to have access to State-funded educational institutions (Aricle 29), and to establish and maintain educational institutions of its choice (Article 30) are also guaranteed. The right to Constitutional remedies is essentially the right to move the Supreme Court of India for enforcement of the above rights (Article 32) The Supreme Court is vested with wide Constitutional powers in this regard. They include the power to issue directions, orders or writs for the enforcement of the fundamerital rignts (Article 32(2). State (i.e. provincial) High Courts too have identical powers (Article 226). As laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the rights conferred by part Ill of the Constitution are void (Article 13), the Courts have the power to adjudge the Constitutional validity of all laws. Furthermore, by virtue of Article 141, the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts in India. Fundamental rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution may be divided, for the sake of ccnvenience, into two categories viz., specified fundamental rights and other fundamental rights (rights not specifically enumerated). 3.4.1 Specified Fundamental Rights Many rights enshrined in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have been recognised specially in the Indian Constitution as 'fundamental rights.' They may be referred to as \"Specified\" fundamental rights because they are mentioned in the Constitution by name. The following table shows the different Articies of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Indian Constitution wherein identical rights are stipulated. Table 3.3 Different Articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Indian Constitution 3.4.2  Fundamental Rights for Citizens only The Indian Constitution has ciassified fundamental rights into two categories: 1) Fundamental rights which are available to citizens only; 2) Fundamental rights available to all persons residing within the territory of India for the time being and subjected to its jurisdiction. The first of the category, which is available to the citizens inciudes: Article 15 relating to prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Article 16 relating to equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of public appointment Article 19 relating to protection of rights a) freedom of speech and expression b) to assemble peaceably and without arms c) to form associations or unions d) to move freely tr roughout the territory of India e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India and f) Article 19(1) (f) relating to the right to own and acquire property was deleted by the Constitution $42^{n d}$ Amendment Act 1978 with effect from 20-06-1979 9) To practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business Article 29 relating to protection of interests of minorities The second category of fundamental rights comprise the remaining fundamental rights which use the word 'Person.' In Hans Muller of Nurenburg v. Superintendent Presidency Jail Calcutta? it was laid down in the judgment that Article 19 applies only to citizens. Fundamental rights mentioned in Article 19, whicn contains the right to \"basic freedoms\", are available only to the citizens of the country. The word 'citizen' that occurs in the above Article has not been used in a sense different from that in which it has been used in part ll of the Constitution dealing with citizenship In Anwar v. State of Jammu and Kashmir2 it was held that non-citizens could not claim fundamental rights provided under Article 19. In Chairman Railway Board and others v. Chandrima $D a s^{33}$ the Supreme Court has observed that: Fundamental rights are available to all the persons of this country and those who are not citizens of this country and who come here as tourists or in any other capacity, are entitled to the protection of their lives in accordance with the Constitutional provisions. They also have a right to life in this country. Thus they also have the right to live with human dignity so long as they are here in India. Article 14 which guarantees equality before law and equal protection of laws within the territory of India is applicable to \"person\" who would also include both the \"citizens\" of this country and non-citizens. In this case, a Bangladeshi national Mrs. Khatoon was gang raped by the Railway employees in a room at the Yatri Niwas of the Howrah Railway Station in West Bengal. The Calcuta High Court allowed compensation of a sum of rupees 10 lakhs to her for having been gang raped. Upholding the decision of the High Court, the Supreme Court held that as a national of another country, she could riot be subjected to a treatment, which was below the dignity, nor could she be subjected to physical violence at the hancs of Governrment employees who outraged her modesty. According to the tone and the tenor of the language used in Ar:icle 21, they are available not only to every citizen of this country but also to a person of another country. The Apex Court also held that since the word 'life' has been used in Article 21 of the Constitution as a basic human right in the same sense as understood in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, there is no reason why it should be given a narrow mearing. Article 39(a) and Article 44 of the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in part IV of the constitution are for the citizens only. 3.4.3 Other Fundamental Rights (Unenumerated Fundamental Rights) A number of rights, which are stated in the Covenant, are not laid down  in part Ill of the Constitution. The Indian  Constitution has specifically enumerated all the fundamental rights.  In Birma v. State of Rajasthan?4 it was held tnat \"treaties which are part of international law do not form part of the taw of the land, unless explicitly made so by the legislative authority.\" Further in Shiv Kumar Sharma and others $v$ Union of India?5 the Delhi High Court held that in India treaties do not have the force of law, and consequently obligations arising therefrom will not be enforceable in municipat courts unless backed by legislation. In A.D.M. Jabalpur v. S. Shukla?6 the Supreme Court by a majority of four to one, held that the Constitution of India did not recognise any natural or common law rights other thar that expressly conferred in the Constitution. The attitude of the Supreme Court has changed especially after 1978. The courts on many occasions by accepting the rule of judicial construction  have held  that  regard  must be  paid   to  International Conventions and norms for constructing domestic law. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India,37 Justice: Bhagwati in the Special Bench for the Supreme Court observed that: The expression 'personal liberty' in article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights, which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Article 19. No person can be deprivedl of his right to go abroad unless there is a law made by the State prescribing the procedure for so depriving him  and  the  deprivation is effected  strictly  in accordance with such procedure. The following are the rights contained in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They are available to the citizens of India through judicial decisions, though they are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution. Right to travel abroad (Article 21) The right to travel abroad is a guaranteed right under Article 12 paragraph (2) of the Covenant on Civil and Political  Rights. In Sathwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramanathan, Assistant Passport Officer, New Delhi38 tre Court held that the right to go abroad is part of an individual's personal liberty within the meaning of Article 21. Right to privacy (Articles 21 and 19 (1) (d)) This right is stipulated under Article 17 paragraph (1) of the Covenant on Civil and Politicai Rights. In Kharak Singh $V.$ Stateof Uttar Pradesh39 it was held by the Supreme Court that the 'domicillary visits' is an infringement of the right to privacy and is violative of the citizen's fundamental rights of personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21. Right against solitary confinement Right to human dignity Right to free legai aid in a criminal trial Right to speedy trial Right against handcuff ng Right against delayed execution Right against custodial violence Right against public hanging Right to health care or doctor's assistance Right to shelter Right to pollution free environment Freedom of the press Right to know Right to compensation Right to release and rehabilitation of bonded labour Right of inmates of protection homes Right of not to be imprisoned for inability to fulfil a contractual obligation. In Jolly George Varghese v. Bank of Cochin40 it was held by the Supreme Court that to cast a person in prison because of his poverty and consequent inability to meet his contractual liability is a violation of Article 21. 3.4.4 Right to Child Education Right to Child Education (Article 21 A) is a new human right, which is  included   in  the  Constitution   by  the  Eighty   Sixth  Constitution Amendment Act, 2002. In order to make the right to free and compulsory education to a child, the Constitution's $83^{r d}$ Amendment Bill 1997 was introduced in Rajya Sabha to insert a new article 21 A in the Constitution. However, the Bill was withdrawn on November 27, 2001. The Constitution $93^{r d}$ Amendment Bill 2001 was introduced and passed by unanimous vote in the Lok Sabha on Novemiber 28, 2001 and the Rajya Sabha on May 14, 2002 with formal amerdments as $86^{t h}$ Constitutional amendment. According to Article 21(A), the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine. Before the Constitutional process started for making the right to education a fundamental righit, the Supreme Court in $1.P.$ Unnikrishnan and others v. The State of Andhra Pradesh41 held that every citizen of this country has the right to free education until he completes the age of fourteen years. 3.5  Directive Principles of State Policy and Human Rights (Judicially non-enforceable rights) Judicially non-enforceable rights in Part IV of the Constitution are chiefly those of economic and social character. However, Article 37 makes it clear that their judicial non-enforceability does not weaken the duty of the State to apply them in making laws, since they are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the county. Additionally. the innovative jurisprudence of the Supreme Court has now read into Article 21 (the right to life and personal liberty) many of these principles and made them enforceable.4\" The duties of the State encompass securing a social order with justice, social, economic and political, striving to minimize and eliminate all inequalities (Article 38), securing for \"the citizens, men and women equally\" the right to an adequate means of livelihood (Article 39 (a), distribution of ownership and control of community resources to subserve the common good (Article 3s(b)), prevention of concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment (Article 39(c)), securing equal pay for equal work for both men and women (Article 39(d), preventing abuse of labour, including child labour (Article 39(e), ensuring of child development (Article 39(f), ensuring of equal justice and free legal aid (Article 39 A), organisation of village democracies (Article 40), provision of the right to work, education and public assistance in case of unemployment, old age sick.ness and disability (Article 41), provision of humane conditions of work (Article 42), living wage and a decent standard of life (Article 43), securing participation of workers in the management of industries (Article 43A), provision of a uniform civil code for the whole country (Article 44), provision for early child care and education to children beloww the age of six years. The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years (Article 45), promotion of educational and economic interest of the weaker sections of the people and their protection from injustice and all forms of exploitation (Article 46), raising the standard of living. improving the level of nutrition and public health and prohibition of intoxicating drinks and of drugs (Article 47), scientific reorganisation of an mal husbandry and agriculture (Article 48). conservation of environment, forests and wildlife (Article 48A), protection of monuments and things of artistic or historica! importance (Article 19), separation of judiciary from the executive (Article 50) and promotion of international peace and security (Article 51). 3.6 Fundamenta! Duties and Human Rights Zleven Part IV(A) of the Constitution embodies the Fundamental Duties of every Indian citizen (Article 51-A). These are: the duties to respect the Constitution and its institutions, to live by the noble ideals of the freedom struggle, to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, to defend  the  country.  to  prornote communal  harmony,  to  renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women, to preserve the cultural heritage, to protect and improve the natura! environment, to have compassion for living creatures, to develop the scientific temper, to safeguard public property ancl abjure violence and to strive towards excelience in all spheres of individual and collective activity. The Eightysixth Constitutional Amendment 2002 inserted a new clause (k) in Article 51(A) instructing \"a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or as the case may be, ward between the ages of 6 and 14 years.\" It would appear that parts IHl, IV and IV(a) of the Constitution heavily depend upon the juciciary for their interpretation and application. The various 'reasonable restrictions' clauses in Part lll, Article 21, and the seldom-used Part IV-A have given the judiciary ample scope for the Judicial Review of administrative and legislative action. Indeed, Article 21 has allowed it to act as a catalyst in prodding the State to implement the directive principles in so far as they directly bear upon \u201clife and persona! liberty.\" 3.7 Political Rights and Human Rights India is the largest representative democracy in the world, based on universal aduit suffrage, providing every Indian of at least eighteen years of age the right to vote. The Constitution provides for direct elections to the House of thie People of the Central Parliament, i.e. the Lok Sabha and the State (Provincial) Legislative Assemblies, once in every five years at the lates1. The members of the State Legislatures do the elections to the Council of States, i.e. Rajya Sabha, which is the upper house of Parliament. The elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies elect the President. Both the Houses of Parliament together elect the: Vice-President. The right to vote, the: right to contest elections, and the conduct of elections are all governed oy the Constitution (Part XV) as well as specia! laws like the Representatiorn of the People Act, 1951. The Constitution provides for an independent Election Commission (Article 324), which has in fact acquited itself quite admirably in the recent elections, both provincial as wel as parliamentary, and set an agenda for clean elections and elimination of the criminal - politician nexus. 3.8 Institutional Framework and Human Rights India is divided into twenty-eight States and seven Union (centrally administered) territories. The Constitution provides for division of legislative functions between Parliament and the State Legislatures. 97 items are placed under Parliament, 66 items are allocated for State Legislatures and 47 are made subject to coricurrent jurisdiction of both, with the power of Parliament overriding in case of overlapping legislation (Article 246 and the seventh Schedule of the Constitution). Parliament has power to make laws, inter lia, on preventive cetention (Item 9. Union List, and item 3. Concurrent list), offences against laws in respect of any matter in the Union List (Iltem 93), and any rmatter not enumerated in any of the three lists (tem 97 and Articie 248). Public order (item 1). prisons and reformatories (Item 3), relief to the disabled and the unemployed (ltem 9), and industries other than those declared by Parliament to be controlled by the Union (Item 24) are among the items in the State List. The Police is a State subject (ltem 2), whereas deployment of any armed forces of the Union or any other force under the control of the Union is in the Union List (Item 2-A). Criminal law and procedure (Iltems 1 and 2). preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of the State, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of essential supplies and services (Item 3), transfer of prisoners (Item 4), actionable wrongs, civil procedure (ltem 13), economic and social planning (Item 20), labour matters (ltems 22, 23 and 24), education (ltem 25). and factories (ltem 36) are in the Concurrent List. Further, Article 253 empowers parliament to make laws for implementation of any treaty, notwithstanding the above distribution of leaislative powers. The executive power of the Union is invested with the Prime Minister and his 'Cabinet' who are responsible to the Parliament. The executive power of a State is vested with the Chief Minister and his Cabinet who are responsible \"o the State Legislative Assembly. The President of india on the advice of the Prime Minister appoints the Governor, the head of a State. There is a common civil service for the whole of India, whose officers head the Union administration and nonmilitary security forces, and also the State administrations and Police forces. There is mobility between the Union and State senior positions. The judiciary is presided over by the Supreme Court. The State judiciary is under the control of a High Court, which in certain respects enjoys even broader powers than the Supreme Court, although the law declared by the Supreme Court binds it. lIn the scheme of the Constitution, there exists a separation of powers among the legislature, the executive and the judicary. with the judiciary being fiercely independent of the other two, charged with the task of enforcing the constitutional norms, including human rights, and adjudicating upon all inter-individual, inter-institutional disputes. To monitor the implemeritation of the Constitutional objectives for the welfare of the weaker secticns of the nation, the Central Government has appointed a National Commission for Minorities, a National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and a National Commission for  Women.  The Nationai  Human  Rights  Commission (N.H.R.C.) came into being in 1993 by virtue of the Protection of Human Rights Act. N.H.R.C. has become an agency to reckon with, and has carved out a place for itseif in the mosaic of 1ndian national institutions for implementation of human rights. The freedom of the Press has been monitored chiefly by the Press Council of India since 1979. 3.9 Judiciary and Human Rights Of the three organs of Government, the judiciary has become a vanguard of human rights in India. It performs this function mainly by innovative interpretation and application of the human rights provisions of the Constitution. The Supreme: Court of India has in the case Ajay Hasia V. Khalid Mujib43 declared that it has a special responsibility, \"to eniarge the range and meaning of the fundamental rights and to advance the human rights jurisprudence.\" As has already been pointed out the Supreme Court of India and the State High Courts have broad powers under the Constitution to enforce the fundamental rights and they have liberally interpreted these powers. The major contributicns of the judiciary to the human rights jurisprudence have been two-fold: (a) the substantive expansion of the concept of human rights under Article 21 of the Constitution, and (b) the procedural innovation of Public Interest Litigation. 3.9.1 Expansion of Article 21 Article 21 reads as follows, protection of life and personal liberty - \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law.\" The expansion of Article 21 of the Constitution has taken place in two respects: a) The expression \"the procedure established by law\" received a new interpretation   not   intended by  the  founding  fathers of  the Constitution. In 1950, the very first year of the Constitution, the Supreme Court in the case A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras,44 reflecting on the intentions of the Constitution-makers, held that \"procedure established by taw\" only meant that a procedure had to be set by law enacted by a Legislature. This phrase was deliberately used in Artcle 21 in preference to the American \"Due Process\" clause. Tnree decades later, in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India case, the Supreme Court noted that \"the Supreme Court rejected its earlier interpretation and holds that the procedure contemplated under Articie 21 is a right, just and fair procedure, not an arbitrary or oppressive procedure.\"45 The procedure, which is reasonable and fair, must now be in conformity with the test of article 14 - \"in effect it has become a Due Process.\" There is no doubt that the experience of National Emergency (1975-1977) prompted the court to go all out for vindication of human rights. Since then every case of infringement of rights by the Legislature has undergone judicial scrutiny in terms of the new interpretation laid down in the Maneka Gandhi's case. Further, this approach has led to procedural due: process innovations such as the right to claim legal aid for the pocr and the right to expeditious trial. b) The judiciary interprets 'the right to life and personal liberty\" to encompass all basic coriditions for a life with dignity and liberty. Such an approach allows it to come down heavily on the system of administration of criminal justice and law enforcement. It also brings into the fold of Article 21 all those directive principles of state policy that are essential for a \"life with dignity.\" Thus, the judiciary has interpreted \u201cLife\" to include the right to possession of each organ of cne's body and a prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatmerit by Police. In the Francis Coralie Mullin v. The Administrator, Union territory of Delhr\u00b0 case, the Supreme Court held that \"life\" couldn't be restricted to mere animal existence, or physical survival. The right to life mearis the right to live with dignity and all that goes with it \u2014 the basic necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing, shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself. Many of the Article 21 cases that came before the High Courts and the Supreme Court often revealed \"a shocking state of affairs and portray a complete lack of concern for human values.\" The Hussainara Khatoon V. Home Secretary, Bihar case:47 It has been held by the Supreme Court that though speedy trial is not specifically enumerated as a fundamental right, it is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21, which deals with the \u2018right to life and liberty'. Justice Bhagwati held \"if a person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure which is not 'reasonable', \u201cfair' or 'just', it would fall foul of Article 21. There can, therefore, be no doubt that speedy trial, and by speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial, is an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21. It was also held by the Supreme Court that 'detention in jail for a period longer than what they would have been sentenced for, if convicted, is illegal as being a violation of their fundamental right Lnder Article 21 of the Constitution. Deoraj Khatri v. State of Bihar case48 raised the case of Police brutality in which 80 suspected criminals were brutally blinded during Police investigation (Bhagalpur Blinding case). The Supreme Court condemned it as a \"barbaric act and a crime against mankind.\" In Sheela Barse v. The State of Maharashtra case,*9 the Court was confronted with the custodial violence against women and it laid down certain guidelines against torture and ill treatment of women in Police custody and jails. The Supreme Court has also read into Article 21 a right to monetary compensation for deprivations of the right to life and liberty suffered at the hands of the State. This was highlighted in the Rudal Shah v. State of Bihar case.5o The emergence of the right to compensation has nulified one of the reservations made by India in its instrument of accession to the human rights Covenants, which stated that the Indian law did not recognize such a right in the event of right deprivation. The heaith problems of workers in the asbestos industry led the Supreme Court in the case Paramanand Katra v. Union of India to rule that the right to life and liberty under Article 21 also encompasses the right of the workers to heaith ard medical aid.51 The right to life has been held to include the right to receive instant medical aid in case of injury and the right of a child to receive free education up to the age of fourteen. 3.9.2 Public Interest Litigation and Human Rights Public Interest Litigation - an expansion of class action under the common law - is a procedural innovation, which the Indian judiciary has by now fairiy perfected on the basis of a concept borrowed from the United States. The rule of 'locus standr normally dictates that he who approaches the court must prove his legal standing vis-a-vis the claim he seeks to vindicate, usually in terms of a legal right or a legal obligation violated by the defendant/respondent causing thereby some injury or damage to him for which law provides a remedy. On the other hand, the public interest litigation is based on the principle that: We cannot write off the weaker victims of injustices; the court's door when they knock shall open... How can a bonded labourer working in a stone quarry ever know of moving the Supreme Court?, asks Justice Krishna lyer, a redoubtable public interest activist judge of the Supreme Court of the seventies. He explains that pubic interest litigation, chiefly, in the realm of public law assists 'all people concerned with governmental lawlessness, negligence of the administration, environmental pollution, public health, product safety, consumer protection and social exploitation being  served  by professionals like  liawyers  and public interest  lobbies;  working  for 'reform  of  decision-making processes in Government and outside, affecting the public at large'. Public Interest Law offers new chailenges and opportunities for the committed lawyers and social groups to serve the unequal segments of society better. This sensitive development is part of democracy (of the disabled) and of the movement to vindicate social justice through professions for the people. As a result, judges with a vision have new universes to behold, and mansions of people's justice to build.52 Justice Krishna lyer realises that the public interest litigation is likely to be abused. Hence he advised that the court should prima facie be satisfied that the information laid before it is of such a nature that it calls for examination. By looking at the credentials of the jnformant, the specific nature of the allegation, the gravity or seriousness of the complaint, and any other relevant circumstances should also be derived. It should also use its own wide investigative faculties as appropriate for the situation.53 Ever since the public interest litigation came to be promoted by the Supreme Court, there has been an ongoing debate in the country between its supporters and opponents. In the Sunil Batra v. Union of India case,54 the Supreme Court entertained a letter from Batra, a prisoner, complaining about the treatment meted out to a fellow prisoner in a jail. The letter activated the Court to deal with a wide variety of issues such as solitary confinement in jails, conditions of under-trial prisoners, sexual exploitation, sexual e:xploitation of blind girls in Schools, detention of mentally ill persons, minimum wages, illegal sale of babies, bonded labour, environmental protection, ill-treatment of freshers in Colleges, better roads, land entitlement, conditions of children in children's homes, treatment of inmates of carehomes, conditions of mental hospitals and deaths at alleged Police encounters. As the court opened its doors wide shedding procedure formalism, many of these issues repeatedly came before it as well as many others such as torture of young prisoners, Police brutality like blinding of suspects during investigation, custodial violence against women prisoners, deaths in Police custody, handcuffing of accused persons facing trials and fetters on incarcerated prisoners. As the legal procedure became deformalised, the court evolved new devices to assist it in dealing with public interest litigation, such as special inquiry\u3001 fact-finding commission, scheme remedies and postdecisional monitoring. A nation-wide Legal Aid Scheme came to be established on the initiative of the Supreme Court.55 In 1982 the Supreme Court promised to examine a range of relevant issues concerning 1he public interest litigation procedure. An examination of these issues may be useful to streamline the public interest litigation law and practice with a view to discouraging abuses. As Justice Krishna lyer remarks: it is \"too late to burke Pll, but always welcome to reaffirm, and refine, eliminate the entropy and abuse of the process.\"s56 It is quite possiole that the burden of a backlog of cases awaiting adjudication is what worries the Court.  But this is never a reason when 'we the People of India demand social justice,' reminds Justice lyer.5? The judiciary should never bite more than it can chew, Justice Sujata Manohar strikes a note of caution in the context of Article 21 of the Constitution. Article 2 embodies a judicially enforceable right. Therefore, it should essentially be a right capable of being protected by a judicial order. A right not capable of such enforcement, if spelled out from Article 21. . . may result in the trivialization of court's pronouncements and may encourage the habit of ignoring them . . . Every human right may not be capable of judicial enforcement.58 It points out the limits and Jimitations of judicial activism. Taking into account thie peculiar nature of public interest litigation, the Supreme Court of India in a public interest litigation, D.K. Basu V. State of West Bengal,9 isslied guidelines to be followed in all cases for arrest and  detention  by the  State  interrogatory  agencies till legal provisions are made on that behalf as preventive measures. The Guidelines are: The Police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification  and   name   tags  with   their  designations.  The particuiars of such Police personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register. The Police officer executing the arrest shall prepare a memo at the time of arrest and shall be attested by at least one witness. This may be either a member of the family of the arrested or a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is made. It shall be countersigned by the arrestee and shall contain the time and date of arrest. A person who has been arrested or detained and is being held in custody in a Police Station or interrogation centre or other lockups, shall be entitled to have one friend or relative or other person known to him or having interest in his welfare being informed as soon as possible that he has been arrested and is being detained in a particular place, unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is himself such a friend or a relative of the arrestee. The time, place of arrest and venue of custody of an arrestee must be notified by the Police when the next friend or reiative of the arrestee lives outside the District or town through the Legal Aid Organisation in the District and the Police Station of the area concerned teiegraphically within 8-12 hours of the arrest. The person arrested must be made aware of his right to have some one informed of his arrest or detention as soon as he is put under arrest or is detained. An entry must be made in the diary at the place of detention regarding the arrest cf the person which shall also disclose the name of the next frierid of the person who has been informed of the arrest and the narnes and particulars of the Police oficials in whose custody the arrestee is. The arrestee should, where he so requests, be also examined at the time of his arres: and the major and minor injuries if any present on his body and must be recorded at that time. The 'Inspection of memo' rnust be signed by both the arrestee and the Police officer effecting the arrest and a copy shall be provided to the arrestee. The arrestee should be subjected to medical examination every 48 hours during his deterition in custody by a doctor from a panel of approved doctors appointed by the Director, Health Services of the State concerned or Union Territory. He should prepare such a panel for all tehsils anc Districts as well. Copies of all the docuiments including the memo of arrest referred to above should be sent to the Magistrate for his record. The arrestee may be permitted to meet his lawyer during interrogation though the latter may not be present throughout interrogation. A Police control room should be provided at all District and State headquarters so that information regarding the arrest and the place of custody of the arrestee can be communicated by the Officer carrying out the arrest within 12 hours of effecting the arrest and at the Police control room it should be displayed on a conspicuous noticeboard. The Supreme Court also insists that the requirements that flow from Articles 21 and 22 (1) of the Indian Constitution are to be strictly followed. These would aprly with equal force to other Government agencies including the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Directorate of Enforcement, Coast Guard, Central Reserve Police Force (C.R.P.F), Border Security Force (B.s.F.) the Central Industrial Security Force (C.1.S.F), the State Armed Police. lritelligence Agencies, such as the Intelligence Bureau, RAW, Central Bureau of Investigation (C.B.l.) and C.l.D. These guidelines are only a few out of a large number of judgements of the apex court in which the court upheld the human rights of the oppressed individuals. 3.10 Media and Human Rights The Information Mecia is an important arm of any modern democratic polity through which the people exercise their freedom of information. The freedom of information, the democratic right to know, is crucial in making all other human rights effective and providing an important safeguard for the enjoyment of all those rights. Traditionally. the vehicle of public irnformation was the Press. Today it is called the media, which include the press, the radio, the television and the internet. The \"Fourth Estate\" plays a crucial role in a large democracy like India where about 1500 different types of newspapers are circulated. The period of National Emergency saw, for the first time, the gagging of the free press. Many then depended on the BBC for 'impartial news about lndia. It is no wonde:r that the freedom of the Press or media became a watchword after eimergency. Disposing of a case o' contempt of court against the editors of two newspapers, the Supreme Court remarked: It is the duty of a true and responsible journalist to provide the people with accurate and impartial presentation of news and his views after dispassionate evaluation of facts and information received by him and to be published as a news item. The editor of a newspaper or a journal, the court said, has a greater responsibility to guard against untruthful news and its publication. If the newspaper publishes what is improper, mischievously false or illegal and abuses its liberty, it must e punished by a court of law. While a free and healthy press is indispensable to the functioning of a true democracy, the court said, \"the freedom of the press is subject to reasonable restraints.\"60 Since the 1970's the media in lndia have played a central role in sensitising people with intormation about governance, development, science and technology, foreigr relations and so on. However, of late it has also come in for criticisn1, as highlighted by the above Supreme Court decision. There has been e decline in journalistic credibility, as noted by the Chairman of the Press Council of India himself in a seminar.'1 Senior journalists feel that the media shies away from important 'people's issues like tribal issues, that it is losing social content and becoming a consumer product with a manager overshadowing the editor.62  While the media is \"a vital leverage to keep the rulers in check,\" it has failed \"to educate people to assert their claim to the right to information,\" observes another senior journalist.63  The press also has come in for rough treatment by terrorists, insurgents, and some individual politicians. The Chairman of the Press Council condemned increasing commercialism and corrupt practices emphasizing the need to arrest them.\"4 The media also has a tendency to launch \"trials by the media,\" even sentencing by the media, even while a court proceeding is underway. Considering the totality of the impact of the media during the past two decades, despite the above pitfalls, one must recognise that the contribution of the media in revealing and highlighting human rights causes has been most impressive. A colonial law relating to official secrecy, the Official Secrets Act, 1923, however, remains an impediment in the effective exercise of the freedom of information. 3.11 Some other Measures of Protection of Human Rights under Indian Law The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act, 1976 Employment of Children Act, 1938 (Amended in 1985) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986 Sati (Prevention) Act, 987 The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 The National Commission for Women Act, 1990 The National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 The National Commission for Safari Karamcharis Act, 1993 The National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993 The Mental Health Act, 1993 The Persons with Disabilities (Equal opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. 3.12 Conclusion The Indian Constitution is a document rich in human rights jurisprudence. This is an elaborate charter on human rights ever framed by any State in the world. Part lll of the Indian Constitution may be characterised as the 'Magna Carta' of India. The Judiciary in India plays a significant role in protecting human rights. The Indian Courts have now become the courts of the poor and the struggling masses and let open their portals to the poor, the ignorant, the illiterates, the downtrodden, the have-nots, the handicapped and the half-hungry, half-naked countrymen.

        "markdown": "Dattopant Thengadi National Board for Workers Education & Development Ministry of Labour & Employment, Govt of India Human Rights Often, we see ourselves surrounded with the questions like what are the rights, (?) what rights constitute human rights, (?) what is their nature (?) and who is responsible for upholding them (?). This paper the aims of to provide answers and quick insight into the enforcement aspect of the human rights. Introduction: \u2018Right\u2019 is the power which the man has, to make a person or persons to do or restrains from doing certain act or acts so far as the power arises from society imposing a legal duty upon the person or persons. The law protects the legal right of every citizen. By being a citizen of the country, the people are given the legal right. It is the duty of every individual to protect the rights of each individual. Human rights have become the cornerstone of every country in the world since their adoption by United Nations. However, states being the representative organs of people, the rights guaranteed by international law of human rights need to be institutionalized to augment the rights of everyone at the national domain. By such institutionalization with a constitutional guarantee, they try to protect the fragile nature of individual against the national and international threats The denial of human rights and fundamental freedoms not only is an individual and personal tragedy, but also creates conditions of social and political unrest, sowing the seeds of conflict within and between societies and nations. What are human rights: Human rights are rights we have simply because we exist as human beings - they are not granted by any state. These universal rights are inherent to us all, regardless of nationality, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status. They range from the most fundamental - the right to life - to those that make life worth living, such as the rights to food, education, work, health, and liberty. Section 2(1) (d) of the Protection of Human Rights (PHR) Act defines Human Rights as the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India. Nature of human rights: 1. Universal and inalienable: The principle of universality of human rights is the cornerstone of international human rights law. This means that we are all equally entitled to our human rights. Human rights are inalienable. They should not be taken away, except in specific situations and according to due process. For example, the right to liberty may be restricted if a person is found guilty of a crime by a court of law. 2. Indivisible and interdependent All human rights are indivisible and interdependent. This means that one set of rights cannot be enjoyed fully without the other. For example, making progress in civil and political rights makes it easier to exercise economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, violating economic, social and cultural rights can negatively affect many other rights. 3. Equal and non-discriminatory Article 1 of the UDHR states: \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\u201d Freedom from discrimination, set out in Article 2, is what ensures this equality. Non-discrimination cuts across all international human rights law. This principle is present in all major human rights treaties. Nondiscrimination is also the central theme of two core instruments: the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 4. Both rights and obligations All States have ratified at least 1 of the 9 core human rights treaties, as well as 1 of the 9 optional protocols. Eighty per cent of States have ratified 4 or more. This means that States have obligations and duties under international law to respect, protect and fulfill human rights. The obligation to respect means that States must refrain from interfering with or curtailing the enjoyment of human rights. The obligation to protect requires States to protect individuals and groups against human rights abuses. The obligation to fulfill means that States must take positive action to facilitate the enjoyment of basic human rights. HUMAN RIGHTS: ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM 1. Human Rights Act, 1993 India being a party to a number of international legal documents on human rights and to give effect to Art 51(c) of the Constitution of India, it enacted the 'Human Rights Act in 1993' to extend a speedy protection mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights. The objective of the Act is to establish a Commission of Human Rights both at the level of Union and States. It also proposes to establish Human Rights Courts at the District level in order to address the issue of human rights that need to be redressed at a quick span. In 2019, the act was amended and brought in a number of provisions for the effective functioning of the Commission. Since the implementation of the Act, the Government of India and the States in the country established commissions of Human Rights. 2. Judicial organs (Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court) The judiciary is an important and vital organ to promote not only the principles of democracy and the rule of law, but also ensures that human rights are protected in the true spirit and philosophy with which they are advocated. As per the provisions of the Constitution, especially, directive principles of state policy, there is an inherent obligation on the state to take affirmative action in many areas to usher the fundamental rights. If state fails to discharge its obligations, the judiciary is the only natural organ which can compel a state to take positive action in order to make the rights effective. Supreme Court of India Being the highest court of the country, its decisions are binding on all legal organs and people. It has a number of inherent powers to exercise to uphold principles of rule of law and the provisions of the constitution. It exercises powers to issue various writs and orders under Article 32 of the constitution to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under the constitution. Under Article 131 it exercises jurisdiction in case if there arises a dispute between the Union and State or between States apart from other jurisdictions to entertain cases of civil and criminal nature High Court of States There are 25 High Courts in India. The High Courts are the highest judicial authority of a State. They have judicial and administrative powers. Accordingly, the administrative province of High Court extends to all the lower courts and tribunals working in a state or jurisdiction conferred by law. On the lines of the Supreme Court, the High Court's being constitutional courts have a number of powers to protect the rights of citizens. According to Article 226, the High Courts are empowered to issue writs of various kinds to protect the constitutional rights of affected people. The powers of a High Court in comparison to the Supreme Court are very wide and far to issue writs in the Protection and Promotion of constitutional rights in the sense that Supreme Court can issue writs under Article 32 only for the enforcement of fundamental rights and no other rights. Thus, the provisions of Article 32 and 226 confer unfettered powers on judiciary not only to augment the rights guaranteed under the constitution, but also to inject the philosophical framework of international law of human rights. 3. National Human Rights Commission: The National Human Rights Commission, India has been set up by an Act of Parliament under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 for the protection and promotion of human rights. The Head quarter of the Commission is New Delhi. The functions of the Commission as stated in Section 12 of the Act and apart from enquiry into complaints of violation of human rights or negligence in the prevention of such violation by a public servant, the Commission also studies treaties and international instruments on human rights and make recommendations for their effective implementation to the Government. The Commission is responsible for spreading of human rights awareness amongst the masses and encouraging the efforts of all stake holders in the field of human rights literacy not only at the national level but at international level too. NHRC is a unique institution because it is one of the few National Human Rights Institutes (NHRIs) in the world whose Chairperson is the former Chief Justice of the country. The world looks at NHRC of India as a role model in promoting and monitoring effective implementation of promotion and protection of human rights. The NHRC, India plays an active role in coordinating with other NHRIs of the world to enhance awareness from the perspective of human rights. 4. State Human Rights Commission The Protection of Human Rights Act of 1993 is the reason for the creation of the National Human Rights Commission. This act also allows the creation of the Human Rights Commission at the state level. This body has to ensure that there is no violation of the human rights related to subjects covered under the state list (List-II) and concurrent list (List-III) of the seventh schedule of the Constitution of India. Currently, 26 states have already made their respective State Human Rights Commission. Currently, 26 states have already made their respective State Human Rights Commission. The major functions of the States Human Rights Commission are as follows: To make sure that no one is violating human rights and that all the government officials are doing their duties honestly, to mediate the pending legal proceedings including allegations of human rights violations, to devise steps to effectively implement constitutional and other legal provisions that provide a shield to human rights and to spread human rights literacy and make people aware of the rights and measures that are present to protect their rights. 5. Commissions on Women, Children, Minority and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes The Government of India in accordance with international and national obligations since independence adopted a number of policies and enacted special legislations extending a wide variety of concessions to enrich these people on par with other sections of the society. In order to integrate these people with other advanced groups of the polity, to provide quick span of justice, to protect their rights and to promote their welfare, the government of India in order to discharge its international and national legal commitments, established various independent commissions to help them to achieve tenets of social justice philosophy of human rights. One of the Landmark Judgements of Human Rights law in India Vishaka and Ors. v State of Rajasthan (1997): This case showcases one instance of discrimination against women. An NGO and a women\u2019s rights group known as \u2018Vishaka\u2019 along with four other organizations came together and filed a PIL against a brutal gang rape. It laid its focus on the enforcement of the fundamental rights of women at the Workplace under the provisions of Article 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India, it also raised the issue of the need for protection of women from sexual harassment at Workplace. The Court rose to the occasion and did come up with several guidelines to stop sexual harassment at workplaces and these guidelines are popularly known as Vishakha Guidelines. The Court declared that in order to meaningfully dispose of the case, a set of guidelines are necessary. The Court defined sexual harassment as any physical touch or conduct, any unpleasant taunt or misbehaviour, showing of pornography and asking for any kind of sexual favours. It was held that sexual harassment at the workplace should be informed, produced and circulated. Every act of harassment shall be dealt with in an appropriate manner which shall include criminal proceedings and disciplinary action. For the time-bound and effective redressal of complaints, a robust mechanism should be in place at workplaces. A complaints committee should be put in place which should be headed by a woman and more than half of its members should also be women. In order to prevent any pressure from the higher-ups at the workplace, a third party like an NGO should be involved. Moreover, concrete steps must be taken to create awareness at the workplace as to what sexual harassment is and how to approach appropriate people if someone is harassed at the workplace. Seventeen years after the Vishakha Guidelines were pronounced, the Parliament passed the Sexual Harassment at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.",

Both rights and obligations All States have ratified at least 1 of the 9 core human rights treaties, as well as 1 of the 9 optional protocols. Eighty per cent of States have ratified 4 or more. This means that States have obligations and duties under international law to respect, protect and fulfill human rights. The obligation to respect means that States must refrain from interfering with or curtailing the enjoyment of human rights. The obligation to protect requires States to protect individuals and groups against human rights abuses. The obligation to fulfill means that States must take positive action to facilitate the enjoyment of basic human rights. HUMAN RIGHTS: ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM 1. Human Rights Act, 1993 India being a party to a number of international legal documents on human rights and to give effect to Art 51(c) of the Constitution of India, it enacted the 'Human Rights Act in 1993' to extend a speedy protection mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights. The objective of the Act is to establish a Commission of Human Rights both at the level of Union and States. It also proposes to establish Human Rights Courts at the District level in order to address the issue of human rights that need to be redressed at a quick span. In 2019, the act was amended and brought in a number of provisions for the effective functioning of the Commission. Since the implementation of the Act, the Government of India and the States in the country established commissions of Human Rights. 2. Judicial organs (Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court) The judiciary is an important and vital organ to promote not only the principles of democracy and the rule of law, but also ensures that human rights are protected in the true spirit and philosophy with which they are advocated. As per the provisions of the Constitution, especially, directive principles of state policy, there is an inherent obligation on the state to take affirmative action in many areas to usher the fundamental rights. If state fails to discharge its obligations, the judiciary is the only natural organ which can compel a state to take positive action in order to make the rights effective. Supreme Court of India Being the highest court of the country, its decisions are binding on all legal organs and people.  It has a number of inherent powers to exercise to uphold principles of rule of law and the provisions of the constitution. It exercises powers to issue various writs and orders under Article 32 of the constitution to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under the constitution. Under Article 131 it exercises jurisdiction in case if there arises a dispute between the Union and State or between States apart from other jurisdictions to entertain cases of civil and criminal nature High Court of States There are 25 High Courts in India. The High Courts are the highest judicial authority of a State. They have judicial and administrative powers. Accordingly, the administrative province of High Court extends to all the lower courts and tribunals working in a state or jurisdiction conferred by law. On the lines of the Supreme Court, the High Court's being constitutional courts have a number of powers to protect the rights of citizens. According to Article 226, the High Courts are empowered to issue writs of various kinds to protect the constitutional rights of affected people. The powers of a High Court in comparison to the Supreme Court are very wide and far to issue writs in the Protection and Promotion of constitutional rights in the sense that Supreme Court can issue writs under Article 32 only for the enforcement of fundamental rights and no other rights. Thus, the provisions of Article 32 and 226 confer unfettered powers on judiciary not only to augment the rights guaranteed under the constitution, but also to inject the philosophical framework of international law of human rights. 3. National Human Rights Commission: The National Human Rights Commission, India has been set up by an Act of Parliament under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 for the protection and promotion of human rights. The Head quarter of the Commission is New Delhi. The functions of the Commission as stated in Section 12 of the Act and apart from enquiry into complaints of violation of human rights or negligence in the prevention of such violation by a public servant, the Commission also studies treaties and international instruments on human rights and make recommendations for their effective implementation to the Government. The Commission is responsible for spreading of human rights awareness amongst the masses and encouraging the efforts of all stake holders in the field of human rights literacy not only at the national level but at international level too. NHRC is a unique institution because it is one of the few National Human Rights Institutes (NHRIs) in the world whose Chairperson is the former Chief Justice of the country. The world looks at NHRC of India as a role model in promoting and monitoring effective implementation of promotion and protection of human rights. The NHRC, India plays an active role in coordinating with other NHRIs of the world to enhance awareness from the perspective of human rights. 4. State Human Rights Commission The Protection of Human Rights Act of 1993 is the reason for the creation of the National Human Rights Commission. This act also allows the creation of the Human Rights Commission at the state level. This body has to ensure that there is no violation of the human rights related to subjects covered under the state list (List-II) and concurrent list (List-III) of the seventh schedule of the Constitution of India. Currently, 26 states have already made their respective State Human Rights Commission. Currently, 26 states have already made their respective State Human Rights Commission. The major functions of the States Human Rights Commission are as follows: To make sure that no one is violating human rights and that all the government officials are doing their duties honestly, to mediate the pending legal proceedings including allegations of human rights violations, to devise steps to effectively implement constitutional and other legal provisions that provide a shield to human rights and to spread human rights literacy and make people aware of the rights and measures that are present to protect their rights. 5. Commissions on Women, Children, Minority and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes The Government of India in accordance with international and national obligations since independence adopted a number of policies and enacted special legislations extending a wide variety of concessions to enrich these people on par with other sections of the society. In order to integrate these people with other advanced groups of the polity, to provide quick span of justice, to protect their rights and to promote their welfare, the government of India in order to discharge its international and national legal commitments, established various independent commissions to help them to achieve tenets of social justice philosophy of human rights. One of the Landmark Judgements of Human Rights law in India Vishaka and Ors. v State of Rajasthan (1997): This case showcases one instance of discrimination against women.  An NGO and a women\u2019s rights group known as \u2018Vishaka\u2019 along with four other organizations came together and filed a PIL against a brutal gang rape. It laid its focus on the enforcement of the fundamental rights of women at the Workplace under the provisions of Article 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India, it also raised the issue of the need for protection of women from sexual harassment at Workplace. The Court rose to the occasion and did come up with several guidelines to stop sexual harassment at workplaces and these guidelines are popularly known as Vishakha Guidelines. The Court declared that in order to meaningfully dispose of the case, a set of guidelines are necessary. The Court defined sexual harassment as any physical touch or conduct, any unpleasant taunt or misbehaviour, showing of pornography and asking for any kind of sexual favours. It was held that sexual harassment at the workplace should be informed, produced and circulated. Every act of harassment shall be dealt with in an appropriate manner which shall include criminal proceedings and disciplinary action. For the time-bound and effective redressal of complaints, a robust mechanism should be in place at workplaces. A complaints committee should be put in place which should be headed by a woman and more than half of its members should also be women. In order to prevent any pressure from the higher-ups at the workplace, a third party like an NGO should be involved. Moreover, concrete steps must be taken to create awareness at the workplace as to what sexual harassment is and how to approach appropriate people if someone is harassed at the workplace. Seventeen years after the Vishakha Guidelines were pronounced, the Parliament passed the Sexual Harassment at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013."

The Constitution not only grants equality to women, but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour of women. Within the framework of a democratic polity, our laws, development policies, Plans and programmes have aimed at women\ufffds advancement in different spheres.

Despite opposition concerns about democratic principles, the Congress government proceeded with the amendment, citing international examples of regulating speech to prevent abuse.

Though all of these six Fundamental Freedoms are not absolute. They contain certain restraints and exceptions within them which are postulated in Article 19(2) to 19(6).\\\n\\ Freedom of Speech and Expression - Article 19(1)(a) grants citizens the right to freely express their thoughts, opinions, and ideas. This includes the freedom to express oneself through speech, writing, printing, visual representations, or any other means. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right for the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign nations, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to an offense, or the sovereignty and integrity of Parliament.\\\n\\\nThe first set of grounds, namely, the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States and public order are all grounds referable to national interest. Whereas the second set of grounds, namely, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation and incitement to an offense are all concerned with the interest of the society. However it is the constitutional obligation of the judiciary to ensure that the restrictions imposed by a law on the media are reasonable and relate to the purposes specified in Article 19(2).Because reasonable restrictions contemplated under the Indian Constitution brings the matter in the domain of the court as the question of reasonableness is a question primarily for the Court to decide. Freedom of speech and expression is a crucial right which is recognized by Article 19(l)(a), It has been held to be a basic and indivisible right for a democratic polity.\\\n\\\nIn ,Patanjali Shastri, C.J. observed:\u201cFreedom of speech and of the press lay at the foundation of all democratic organizations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular government, is possible\u201dThe expression \u2018Freedom of press\u2019 is part of the ambit of article 19 and it means the right to print and publish without any interference from the state or any other public authority.

This was done to enable the state to make laws that, in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, place reasonable restrictions on the enjoyment of the rights conferred by sub-clauses (a), (b), and (c) of clause 1 of the article.][ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Ninety-seventh Amendment) Act, 2011,was proposed to overcome the difficulties faced by Cooperative societies and improve their performance and status in the country. The extensive establishment of cooperatives was envisioned as one of the attempts to achieve social and economic justice and the equitable distribution of the advantages of progress. According to this Amendment, these societies are given constitutional status and are legally protected while also maintaining their autonomous or democratic functioning. The Constitution was amended to require that the states guarantee the autonomy of cooperatives, and as a result, state governments are now required to support the voluntary formation, autonomous decision-making, democratic control, and operation of cooperatives. The Act witnessed many changes such as modification in Part III of Article 19(1)(c) with the insertion of the words \u201cor co-operative societies\u201d, and the addition of Article 43B (working towards enhancing the co-Operative Societies\u2019 Voluntary formation, independent operation, and professional management) and Part IX B to the Indian Constitution. However, the 97th Amendment faced challenges in the High Court of Gujarat as the Parliament didn\u2019t ask for approval from the state legislatures before passing the bill. The ratification/approval is necessary for matters concerning states and since the cooperative societies are a part of the state legislature, ratification was required. On July 20, 2021, the Supreme Court of India declared the 97th Amendment Act Unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court ratification from states was necessary to pass the amendment which didn\u2019t take place. The Supreme Court also said that the responsibility of Multistate Co-Operative societies is of the Centre while that of the State co-operative societies is of the state. As of the current scenario, parts of the 97th Amendment on cooperatives are struck down. ][ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII. This amendment may have taken away the scope of speedy remedy under Article 32 for the violation of Right to Property because it is no more a Fundamental Right. Making it a legal right under the Constitution serves two purposes: Firstly, it gives emphasis to the value of socialism included in the preamble and secondly, in doing so, it conformed to the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution. ] Original text Rate this translation Your feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate",

A city park should be a welcoming place that puts people at ease. However, the design and environment of a park can significantly impact people\u2019s perception of its safety and may influence whether they feel comfortable visiting. Characteristics like poor or being prone to vandalism can turn people away from visiting. Your city\u2019s parks and recreation department can take several steps to make your city parks safer and more inviting for the community. Gain some tips for keeping city parks safer in this guide. 1. Keep Safety in Mind When Designing Your Park Improving park safety starts in the park design and construction process. Certain aspects of park design, like the layout and visibility, are essential factors that influence safety. Here are a few considerations to keep in mind if your park is still under construction: Layout: The ability to comfortably navigate the park is a major factor contributing to visitors feeling safe. A confusing park layout might have many confusing paths and disorienting turn-offs. Consider adding easily recognizable landmarks or reference points to help people find their way. Clear-defined pathways and easy-to-locate entrances and exits are also essential elements to include. Isolation: Areas of isolation have low visibility and might make visitors feel like they would not be seen or heard if they needed help. It may be impossible to eliminate all isolated areas, depending on your park\u2019s terrain. However, taking steps to improve sightlines in your park and even installing public phone stations can help reduce the feeling of isolation. Opportunities for vandalism: Vandalism can occur nearly anywhere and takes many forms, from graffiti to broken streetlights. Increasing public visibility in your park can discourage vandals, as can creating a city park that welcomes families. Another effective strategy is to educate your community about the consequences of vandalism. 2. Install Good Lighting Lighting is vital to public park safety, especially if people use the park after dusk. People feel more comfortable in well-lit areas, whether going for a solo jog or taking their family for a picnic. Having ample and strategically-placed lighting is critical for encouraging community members to visit the city park. Install good lighting in parking lots and around park facilities, such as playground equipment and restrooms. Pay attention to areas where people frequently gather, such as park or . Pathways should also be well-lit to help people navigate the park routes. You may also consider motion-triggered lighting in some areas. 3. Perform Regular Inspections Regular inspections are vital to ensuring city park safety. Having a team that conducts inspections of your park can help you identify areas that need attention and prevent hazardous issues from arising. Here are a few elements to look for during your park inspections: Burned-out or broken lights Knocked over benches or picnic tables Slip-and-fall hazards in or outside restrooms Broken concrete or potholes Vandalism Maintain Your Equipment Playgrounds are another area of the park that requires regular inspections. Broken elements or chipped plastic can occur over time if your playground structures are older or have been misused. Broken components, jagged edges and protruding nails are all serious risks. If your playground structures are too seriously damaged, you might need to . Following can help keep your city park in top condition. During regular safety inspections, check for broken playground components or loose connections. Tighten any loose bolts and replace broken playground elements. Check for wood splinters, rust and peeling paint, as these could all indicate issues with the equipment\u2019s structure. You may also need to take additional steps to . Keep Things Clean Maintaining a clean city park encourages people to enjoy all the activities your park has to offer. Litter-like food, wrappers and other trash is unsightly and discourages visitors. A buildup of trash in your playground can also pose a health hazard by creating an environment where bacteria thrive. During your inspections, make sure to look around for litter. Dispose of wrappers, cups, napkins and other types of trash as soon as you notice them to prevent pileup. Providing plenty of can help remind park visitors to keep the area clear of litter. 4. Put Up Clear Signage promotes easy navigation for visitors and improves city park safety. Signage displays the rules of the park and its facilities for all to see, encouraging visitors to help keep one another safe while they use the park. You can also use signage to encourage people to report suspicious activity and vandalism. One aspect of park signage is playground safety guidelines. Posting a sign with playground rules can educate parents and children about what kind of behavior is expected when they enter the park. Using signage with positive messages rather than a list of things not to do can encourage a sense of ownership and community among park visitors. 5. Consider Video Surveillance Another way to increase public park safety is installing surveillance cameras if it\u2019s within your means. While informal surveillance through increased visibility can help, video surveillance is a powerful tool for keeping parks safe and discouraging dangerous behavior. Video surveillance takes live footage that can be archived and viewed later by city park officials if needed. With extra visibility into what goes on at your park, you can deter vandalism, theft and other acts of violence. Install video cameras in well-lighted areas to discourage any misconduct. It can be helpful to have the live footage displayed at your parks and recreation department to encourage additional surveillance. 6. Utilize Access Control You might decide that some areas of your city park, like secluded areas or restrooms, shouldn\u2019t be accessible at all times of the day. For instance, you might close park restrooms after sunset to discourage loitering or vandalism or limit pool access when a lifeguard isn\u2019t available. Remote access control might be the easiest solution if you need to keep some spaces inaccessible. Typically, someone has to physically lock a door or close a gate to keep visitors out. With remote access control, you can remotely lock doors and close areas when they\u2019re off-limits.

It is therefore important to bear the following in mind: 1.) Read the Sign: Public safety and prohibitory signs are constantly put up in and around public places for a reason. They are meant to warn people or inform them of certain things. For example, when you see a: \u201cDo not cross\u201d it is meant to inform people that there may be some form of danger in that particular area. For example, if you buy some fast food, enjoy it, but don\u2019t forget to dispose of the wrapping or leftover paper in the bin. Observing these signs will ensure public health and safety. Litter on the streets will ultimately lead to the spread of infections and diseases. 2.) Watch what you eat: When in a public place like a restaurant or a hotel, it is good to try what is on the menu. But be mindful of new food trials. Also, if it is a hot day or you tend to travel a lot, stick to light foods and cool water/ drinks. 3.) Don\u2019t leave things: It\u2019s not nice to leave things lying around. Don\u2019t litter your surroundings. When you eat snacks, don\u2019t make a mess. If you do, wipe the area clean. Keep in mind that someone else will be sitting at the same spot after you leave. The person shouldn\u2019t soil their clothes or shoes because of something you dropped or left behind. (Have you ever sat on a piece of chewed gum?) 4.) Stay alert: Be observant! Notice the person, billboard, house, or shop next to you and around you so that in the event of any incident, you will remember them. When in public places, it is vital to be on alert at all times. Pay attention to what is happening around you. Keep an eye on the people around you so that you are alert to any suspicious activity or persons.

Using Electronics - MP3 Player & Cell Phones According to the New York City Police Department, the snatching of electronic devices is on the rise across the city and in many other large cities around the world. This is due to both the increased value and ubiquity of these devices. A common element in these incidents is that the victims are not paying attention to their surroundings, distracted by the device in question. Quite often the perpetrator follows the victim from behind and snatches the electronic device right out of his or her hand. In a number of these incidents, the perpetrators were riding bicycles / mopeds when they targeted their victim. These events are not limited to the streets and have also occurred on subways and buses. To avoid being a victim: Pay attention to your surroundings, minimize the amount of time you talk on your cell phone in public places. If you suspect you are being followed, go into an open store or a and have the clerk call the Police or Public Safety right-away. Keep all electronic devices in an inside jacket pocket.

Safety Tips while using Ride Share Services like Uber & Lyft Now that the vast majority of Americans know about Uber or Lyft, millions of people count on a safe and convenient ride with just a few taps on the phone. But stories like the one about the South Carolina college student who was killed after getting into a car she mistook for an Uber raise questions about what riders can do to maximize their safety. Here are some key safety tips to help maximize your safety when using rideshare services like Uber and Lyft: Wait for your ride indoors - This prevents you from standing outside unnecessarily with a phone in your hand, signaling to passing motorists that you're waiting for someone to pick you up. Instead, wait until your driver is close or has arrived before going outside. Confirm details when the car arrives - Don't just look at what time your driver is coming. Pay attention to the make, model, and color of the car, as well as the driver's name and photo. Make sure to match the license plate number on your screen to the one you see in real life. Always ask \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d - The University of South Carolina and the family of Samantha Josephson are spearheading the campaign to promote rideshare safety by always positively identifying your driver. Never get into an Uber, Lyft or any other private car unless the driver can first identify you by name. If they\u2019re your actual driver, they will also know your destination. Map your own route during the ride - This is especially important if you're in a different city and aren't familiar with the route. By monitoring your own GPS navigation, you'll see if the driver is leading you astray. Don't share private information with your driver - This includes your personal phone number. The Uber app automatically encrypts both the driver's number and the passenger's digits to protect both sides' privacy. You should never share credit card info with the driver. All Lyft and Uber fares are paid through the app, and tips can be added there, too. Ride in the back seat - If you're the only passenger in the car, riding in the back seat gives both the passenger and driver more personal space. It also ensures you're able to get out on either side to avoid traffic. Tell a friend where you're going and who you're with - Both Lyft and Uber let you quickly and easily share who your driver is, where you're going and when you're supposed to get there. The \"share status\" option in the Uber app gives your friend your driver's name, photo, license plate and location. Your friend can then track your trip and see your estimated time of arrival -- even if he or she doesn't have the app. The \"send ETA\" feature on the Lyft app is very similar. It sends a text to your friend with details about the car, the driver and how far along you are on the route. Check out video: Home Safety Have your keys ready before you get to the door. Look back before entering your building or home. If you live in an apartment, close the lobby door behind you, especially if a stranger is approaching. Do not hold the door open for strangers. Make all visitors and delivery persons use the doorbell. When placing your name on mailboxes or on your bell, use only the last name, e.g., The Smiths. When recording an outgoing message on your answering machine, avoid leaving your name, phone number or a message that indicates you're not at home. A good message is, \"We are unable to answer the phone. Please leave a message.\" Say it confidently. Prevent Theft of Unattended Packages at Your Building There are steps you can take to help prevent theft of unattended packages from happening to you or your neighbors. Pick up packages as quickly as possible. Leaving packages in the lobby for an extended period increases the chances of theft. Most major shipping companies offer online package tracking, and some can even send you a notification when your package arrives. Utilize these and other services to avoid leaving your delivery unattended for long periods of time. Don't allow building access blindly. Verify a visitor\u2019s identity over the intercom before letting them in. Keep an eye out for suspicious activity like loitering and \"piggybacking.\" People may wait outside the building for someone to leave or enter, allowing them access to an open door. If you believe someone has entered the building on false pretenses, call Public Safety immediately. Request a signature or schedule a delivery . Many shipping companies allow you to request a specific time frame for delivery, such as an evening or weekend when you know you will be home. You can also request that the package not be left without a signature. That way, if you are not around to sign, the carrier will try delivering your package at a later date. Use a locker or other secure location. Sign up for free services such as and or use to deliver your package to a local retail store or another secure location until you are able to pick it up. The on 116th and Broadway and on 115th and Broadway will also hold packages for pickup upon request. Visit their websites to learn more. Ship your items where you have the best chance of receiving them , such as your office or place of work. Family members, trusted neighbors, or friends may be home when you are not. Consider asking them to accept packages on your behalf or hold them until you arrive. Take Crime Prevention To Work When you go to work, don't leave your crime prevention sense at home. Almost any crime that can happen at home or in your neighborhood can happen in the workplace. But common-sense prevention skills can help make life \"at work\" safer for all. Help Prevent Office Theft and Other Crimes Keep your purse, wallet, keys, or other valuable items with you always or locked in a drawer, file cabinet or closet. Don't have the key? Check with your office manager to order a key. Check the identity of any strangers who are in your office or in the hallway- ask whom they are visiting and if you can help them find that person. If this makes you uncomfortable, call Public Safety 212-854-5555 for the Morningside Campus, 212-853-3333 for the Manhattanville campus or 212-305-7979 for the Medical Center campus and informed them of your suspicions.

If you bring personal items to work, such as a coffee pot, a radio, or a calculator, etc., mark them with your name or set up an appointment to join the NYPD / CU Public Safety\u2019s , please e-mail . This service is FREE. Stepping out of your office? Lock your door even if you're going next door or to the restroom for a short time.

Call Public Safety for an escort to your car of public transportation, 212-854-SAFE (7233) @ Morningside Campus, 212-853-3301 @ Manhattanville Campus or 212-305-8100 @ Medical Center Campus.

For more information on ID Theft or what to do if you are a victim, please go to Job / Fraudulent Check Scams Scammers know that finding a job can be tough especially now during this pandemic. To trick people looking for honest work, scammers advertise where real employers and job placement firms do. They also use to make you think that they are coming from a legitimate organization, person or even a member of the Columbia Community. They make upbeat promises about your chances of employment, and virtually all of them ask you to pay them for their services before you get the job. But the promise of a job isn\u2019t the same thing as a job. If you have to pay for the promise, it\u2019s likely a scam. In some of the reported incidents, the scammers sent to several students here at the University offering employment. \u00a0The scammer went as far as sending the victims a check (fraudulent) via priority mail or a PDF via email.\u00a0 Then then ask the victim \u00a0to deposit the check in their account and immediately start making purchases or sending money. There are many variations to this scam but all end with the same ending\u2026you deposit the check, send them the material or cash and now you get a notice from your bank that the check you deposited was fraudulent. You are now out of the money that you sent them, you are charged a bank fee for the bounced check and a negative report on your credit. Remember NO legitimate company will ask you to pay for any material or certification before giving you the job or even starting a job. While we cannot prevent , we can train ourselves to follow best practice guidelines and report suspicious activity. Do not give out personal information\u00a0via email . Social engineering is the process of deceiving individuals into providing personal information to seemingly trusted agents who turn out to be malicious actors.

Using Electronics - MP3 Player & Cell Phones According to the New York City Police Department, the snatching of electronic devices is on the rise across the city and in many other large cities around the world. This is due to both the increased value and ubiquity of these devices. A common element in these incidents is that the victims are not paying attention to their surroundings, distracted by the device in question. Quite often the perpetrator follows the victim from behind and snatches the electronic device right out of his or her hand. In a number of these incidents, the perpetrators were riding bicycles / mopeds when they targeted their victim.

Safety Tips while using Ride Share Services like Uber & Lyft Now that the vast majority of Americans know about Uber or Lyft, millions of people count on a safe and convenient ride with just a few taps on the phone. But stories like the one about the South Carolina college student who was killed after getting into a car she mistook for an Uber raise questions about what riders can do to maximize their safety. Here are some key safety tips to help maximize your safety when using rideshare services like Uber and Lyft: Wait for your ride indoors - This prevents you from standing outside unnecessarily with a phone in your hand, signaling to passing motorists that you're waiting for someone to pick you up. Instead, wait until your driver is close or has arrived before going outside. Confirm details when the car arrives - Don't just look at what time your driver is coming. Pay attention to the make, model, and color of the car, as well as the driver's name and photo. Make sure to match the license plate number on your screen to the one you see in real life. Always ask \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d - The University of South Carolina and the family of Samantha Josephson are spearheading the campaign to promote rideshare safety by always positively identifying your driver. Never get into an Uber, Lyft or any other private car unless the driver can first identify you by name. If they\u2019re your actual driver, they will also know your destination. Map your own route during the ride - This is especially important if you're in a different city and aren't familiar with the route. By monitoring your own GPS navigation, you'll see if the driver is leading you astray. Don't share private information with your driver - This includes your personal phone number. The Uber app automatically encrypts both the driver's number and the passenger's digits to protect both sides' privacy. You should never share credit card info with the driver. All Lyft and Uber fares are paid through the app, and tips can be added there, too. Ride in the back seat - If you're the only passenger in the car, riding in the back seat gives both the passenger and driver more personal space. It also ensures you're able to get out on either side to avoid traffic. Tell a friend where you're going and who you're with - Both Lyft and Uber let you quickly and easily share who your driver is, where you're going and when you're supposed to get there. The \"share status\" option in the Uber app gives your friend your driver's name, photo, license plate and location. Your friend can then track your trip and see your estimated time of arrival -- even if he or she doesn't have the app. The \"send ETA\" feature on the Lyft app is very similar. It sends a text to your friend with details about the car, the driver and how far along you are on the route. Check out video: Home Safety Have your keys ready before you get to the door. Look back before entering your building or home. If you live in an apartment, close the lobby door behind you, especially if a stranger is approaching. Do not hold the door open for strangers. Make all visitors and delivery persons use the doorbell. When placing your name on mailboxes or on your bell, use only the last name, e.g., The Smiths. When recording an outgoing message on your answering machine, avoid leaving your name, phone number or a message that indicates you're not at home. A good message is, \"We are unable to answer the phone. Please leave a message.\" Say it confidently. Prevent Theft of Unattended Packages at Your Building There are steps you can take to help prevent theft of unattended packages from happening to you or your neighbors. Pick up packages as quickly as possible. Leaving packages in the lobby for an extended period increases the chances of theft. Most major shipping companies offer online package tracking, and some can even send you a notification when your package arrives. Utilize these and other services to avoid leaving your delivery unattended for long periods of time. Don't allow building access blindly. Verify a visitor\u2019s identity over the intercom before letting them in. Keep an eye out for suspicious activity like loitering and \"piggybacking.\" People may wait outside the building for someone to leave or enter, allowing them access to an open door. If you believe someone has entered the building on false pretenses, call Public Safety immediately. Request a signature or schedule a delivery . Many shipping companies allow you to request a specific time frame for delivery, such as an evening or weekend when you know you will be home. You can also request that the package not be left without a signature. That way, if you are not around to sign, the carrier will try delivering your package at a later date. Use a locker or other secure location. Sign up for free services such as and or use to deliver your package to a local retail store or another secure location until you are able to pick it up. The on 116th and Broadway and on 115th and Broadway will also hold packages for pickup upon request. Visit their websites to learn more. Ship your items where you have the best chance of receiving them , such as your office or place of work. Family members, trusted neighbors, or friends may be home when you are not. Consider asking them to accept packages on your behalf or hold them until you arrive. Take Crime Prevention To Work When you go to work, don't leave your crime prevention sense at home. Almost any crime that can happen at home or in your neighborhood can happen in the workplace. But common-sense prevention skills can help make life \"at work\" safer for all. Help Prevent Office Theft and Other Crimes Keep your purse, wallet, keys, or other valuable items with you always or locked in a drawer, file cabinet or closet. Don't have the key? Check with your office manager to order a key. Check the identity of any strangers who are in your office or in the hallway- ask whom they are visiting and if you can help them find that person.

In some of the reported incidents, the scammers sent to several students here at the University offering employment. \u00a0The scammer went as far as sending the victims a check (fraudulent) via priority mail or a PDF via email.\u00a0 Then then ask the victim \u00a0to deposit the check in their account and immediately start making purchases or sending money. There are many variations to this scam but all end with the same ending\u2026you deposit the check, send them the material or cash and now you get a notice from your bank that the check you deposited was fraudulent. You are now out of the money that you sent them, you are charged a bank fee for the bounced check and a negative report on your credit. Remember NO legitimate company will ask you to pay for any material or certification before giving you the job or even starting a job. While we cannot prevent , we can train ourselves to follow best practice guidelines and report suspicious activity. Do not give out personal information\u00a0via email . Social engineering is the process of deceiving individuals into providing personal information to seemingly trusted agents who turn out to be malicious actors. Always verify the authenticity of requests from companies or individuals by contacting them directly. If you are asked to provide personal information via email, you should independently contact the company directly to verify this request. Be suspicious of unknown links or requests sent via email or text message. Do not click on unknown links or answer strange questions sent to your mobile device, regardless of who the sender appears to be. Look at the email address that has sent you the offer. Does it match the name they are providing?\u00a0 University officials will not use a Gmail account to correspond.

Please view informative video from the Federal Trade Commission on Job Scams: Driving Safely Keep your car in good running condition. Make sure there's enough gas to get where you're going and back. Turn the ignition off and take your car keys with you, even if you just running inside for a minute. Roll up the windows and lock car doors, even if you're coming right back. Check inside and out before getting in. Avoid parking in isolated areas. If you are uncomfortable, ask a security guard or store staff to watch you or escort you to your car. Drive to the nearest gas station, open business, or other well-lighted, crowded area to get help if you think you are being followed. Don't head home. Use your cellular phone, if you have one, to call the police if you are being followed or you've seen an accident. Otherwise, stay off your cellular phone while you are driving. Don't pick up hitchhikers. Don't hitchhike. Holiday Safety Reminders As we embrace the holiday spirit, it is important to remember that not everyone shares our merriment. There are Grinches lurking about, ready to swoop in and steal your joy. Don\u2019t let that happen to you. Follow these simple crime prevention tips to make it harder for an opportunistic thief to ruin your holiday. Don't shop 'til you drop: Stay alert and be aware of what is going on around you. Park your car in a well-lighted area; close the windows and lock the door. Don't leave packages and boxes visible through car windows. Lock them in the trunk or take them directly home. Don't carry large amounts of cash. Pay with debit, or credit cards whenever possible. Don't get overburdened with packages; always keep one hand free. Don\u2019t leave your packages unattended; thieves are always looking for unattended packages and shopping bags. Keep your purse close to your body, not dangling loosely. Put your wallet in your front pants pocket or in an inside coat pocket. When shopping online, use common sense to protect against fraud or ID theft: Familiarize yourself with the rules and policies of online stores and auction sites. Only shop with companies you know and make sure that the sites comply with industry security standards. Keep your personal information private and keep your passwords secure. Do not respond to requests for a password or credit card information unless you initiate the transaction. If you\u2019re not going to be home to accept the delivery, USPS, UPS Fed Ex and other package delivery providers offer alternatives that prevent your packages from being left unattended. Lockboxes and secure alternative retail locations are just a couple of options. Visit your courier's website for more details. Don't make your office a target for crooks looking for extra holiday cash: Do not leave gifts lying around an empty office. Secure them in a safe place or lock your office door if possible. Always keep your keys and wallet with you. Secure purses and other valuables in a locked drawer or cabinet. Don't be embarrassed to challenge an unfamiliar face in the office. Remember If you see something say something, call Public Safety immediately 212-854-5555 (MC Campus), 212-305-7979 (Medical Center) and 212-853-3333 (MV Campus) to report suspicious activity or persons. Secure your office when stepping out, even for a minute Students going home for the Holidays, please make sure to secure your room doors and windows. Columbia University Public Safety Wishes You & Your Family a Happy & Safe Holiday Season! Chemical Security Awareness Many chemicals and other hazardous materials used in research and other scholarly activities at a university are also potential targets of theft and criminal activity.\u00a0 The security and safety of chemicals and hazardous materials is the shared responsibility of all users.\u00a0 The brochure linked below -- prepared by -- contains information on awareness, vigilance and preparedness to aid in the safeguarding of these materials . Remember: See Something, Say Something . Safeguarding Your Vehicle and Property Don't Leave the Keys in the Ignition: Vehicles left unattended with keys in the ignition are easily targeted by car thieves. This dangerous practice allows for an easy theft or a joy ride by an inexperienced driver. This commonly occurs around the neighborhood store, deli, coffee shop, or newspaper stand. Remain alert. Don't create an opportunity. Don't become a victim! When leaving your vehicle always: Close Your Windows Turn off the Ignition and REMOVE THE KEYS Lock Your Doors! You might only be a \"minute\" \u2014 but a minute is all a thief needs. Lock up your car and take your keys with you! \u00a0Check out \u201c \u201d from the NYPD. Safeguarding Your Property: Stay alert and be aware of what is going on around you. Park your car in a well-lighted area; close the windows and lock the doors. Don't leave packages and boxes visible through car windows. Lock them in the trunk or take them directly home. While your trunk is better than the passenger compartment for shopping bags and laptops, an experienced thief will often stake out a parking area and watch you transfer your things there. So, before you even get to your location move your valuables to the trunk or wherever they\u2019re out of sight. Always report Suspicious Persons or Activity to the Police by calling 911. Contact your local precinct crime prevention officer or visit for more information on joining effective crime prevention programs for your vehicle such as Glass VIN Etching, Combat Auto Theft and more. Government / International Imposter Scams While at Columbia we hope that you will not be contacted by someone attempting to \u201c \u201d or you of your money. As is true anywhere in the world, there are people who attempt to take advantage of international students and scholars, but with a little knowledge you can learn how to identify a scam and avoid falling victim to the\u00a0scheme. If you think you have been contacted by someone trying to commit fraud, please contact CU Public Safety and follow the instructions under . Public Safety can help you determine if the situation is a\u00a0scam. Understand\u00a0the\u00a0Threats Common Scam\u00a0Themes A scammer will ask for payment via methods such as gift\u00a0cards. Emails offering part time employment\u00a0 that look like they are from Columbia faculty or staff but are not. Before clicking into the link, use a second method to confirm the email is\u00a0legitimate. The caller ID or phone number looks like government agency or police. A caller, texter, or letter will use fear, threats, and intimidation to get what they\u00a0want. A scam requires immediate\u00a0action. A scam includes punishment (often threats of deportation or arrest) for not acting\u00a0immediately. A scammer will keep you on the phone for a long time and will not let you hang up to call back\u00a0later. A scammer will use lots of legal-sounding language such as \u201cfederal regulations\u201d and \u201cvisa fee\u201d to sound as legitimate as\u00a0possible. Common\u00a0Scams . Do not buy gift cards for someone else per their\u00a0request. 'Government officials, Police, Consulate office, etc. ' (scammers using the official numbers) call or text to ask for financial information or to notify them that you have violated immigration\u00a0laws. Employment offers that require you to purchase gift\u00a0cards. Third Party tax forms attempt to collect the refund that is rightfully\u00a0yours. Rental scams where your deposit money is taken, and no one meets you with the keys to move\u00a0in. Online scams when purchasing items on Craigslist or eBay or through\u00a0PayPal. Calls or emails demanding an \u201cinternational student tax\u201d or \u201cvisa fee\u201d which directs the victim to wire money or buy gift\u00a0cards. Calls or emails from someone who claims to be a government representative, and that you\u00a0owe money or have committed some kind of\u00a0fraud. A website charging fees to enter the Green Card\u00a0Lottery. Exercise\u00a0Caution In general, no government agency or reputable company will call or email you unexpectedly and request your personal information or request advance fees for services in the form of wire transfers or gift\u00a0cards. Department of Homeland Security may call you regarding your SEVIS record, but they will never ask for money over the\u00a0phone. Verify the identity of anyone who asks for your personal information over the phone. Ask for a caller's name, ID badge, and phone number and request that you call them back or respond through the entity's customer service\u00a0channels. Do not cash checks that arrive in the mail\u00a0unexpectedly. Do not sign contracts without reading them and fully understanding the\u00a0content. Avoid providing personal data, such as banking information or your social security number, to unknown persons over the phone or\u00a0internet. Scammers may know basic information about you and use that as 'proof', however this information is likely easily searchable online. It's a good idea to check how much of your information is public, such as your phone number and\u00a0address. If anyone pressures you to provide information or money over the phone, it's a scam and you should just hang\u00a0up. If someone asks you to buy a gift card for them, it may be a\u00a0scam. Secure\u00a0Your\u00a0Information Store your Social Security card in a secure location; avoid carrying it with\u00a0you. Shred documents that list personal information such as your Social Security number and banking\u00a0information. Avoid opening emails from unknown sources or clicking on suspicious\u00a0hyperlinks. Equip your computing devices with strong anti-virus software and maintain strong\u00a0passwords. Regularly for suspicious\u00a0activity. Report Anything Suspicious\u00a0to\u00a0Public Safety If you receive a concerning or suspicious\u00a0call. If a letter arrives in the mail which includes threats for not\u00a0acting. If an employer is acting unethically by requiring you to pay money to receive a job offer, or an employment agency is offering to create fake\u00a0credentials.

        "markdown": "8 Safety Tips for Female Digital Nomads in India For adventurous women, India poses a wide range of experiences that span from trekking the frozen Zanskar River, pub-hopping the streets of , and going shoulder-to-shoulder on a night trek with trained guards at Periyar Tiger Reserve. There is a lot to explore in this diverse country, but there\u2019s one question women traveling around India will run into again and again\u2014is India a safe destination for female travelers? With a population of over 1.4 billion, traveling in India can be challenging for women when it comes to the matter of safety, but after six years of exploring this beautiful country, I believe safety is also a state of mind. With the right mindset, cautionary steps, and savvy tech skills, it is possible to plan a safe workation as a woman in India. Here are my essential safety tips for women traveling in India. Choose Assertiveness Over Politeness If you want to travel safely in India, understand when to say no, when to stand up for yourself, and when to walk away. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a chance that you may experience behaviors from men like crossing boundaries, staring, and groping. For example, I\u2019ve found that drivers often crowd and hassle me at train or bus stations to offer their services. Instead of bothering with answering them and trying to be polite, I simply say no and walk away. If you are in a place alone with a man and sense anything unusual, try to walk away to a space with more people around. Once when I was traveling on the train, a man who sat opposite my seat started staring at me. The train was approaching the last station and I was the only one in the compartment. Without hesitation, I got up and switched to the next section of the train where there were a few more people. On the other hand, spaces with too many people can also be dangerous as this is where you are most likely to be groped. It can happen anywhere from a dance floor to a crowded bus, so be aware of your surroundings always. If it does happen to you, make a lot of noise and call for help. In India, being publicly shamed is a huge embarrassment and people will speak up and defend you. Avoid Arriving at Night I have traveled to different parts of India using various modes of transportation. But one thing I religiously stick to while traveling through this country is never arriving at a new destination in the middle of the night. If you don't have any other choice, make sure someone meets you at the bus stop, train station, or airport. Most accommodations offer pick-up services, which is much safer than taking random taxis at night. Try to avoid wandering on foot at night. If you leave a restaurant or pub late at night, ask the front desk or reception to arrange a taxi or auto. If you are commuting within the city alone at night, call someone (or pretend to) and share the taxi number loud enough for the driver to hear. This will make the driver aware that they can't mess up with you. Take a Cab Use taxi apps like Uber and Ola to get around in major cities. Strongly disagree and stand your ground if the driver wants to pick up an unknown person along the way. There are also cab services with women drivers, like in cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Kolkata, and Indore, in Bangalore, and in Jaipur. Try taking sleeper-class compartments mainly used by women, families, and other travelers or women-only compartments during long-distance train journeys to avoid any unpleasant encounters. Set Clear Boundaries Setting boundaries is a balancing act of being friendly and protecting yourself when dealing with men. To make sure they are not misreading your signals, you can call them baiyya, which means brother, so that your diplomatic or social behavior is not misunderstood. Some men may try to ask you personal questions, but you should never reveal too much about yourself or your travel plans. Unless you know them well, never eat or drink anything someone offers you. Safeguard Your Data and Gadgets While traveling in India, always have your gadgets locked and password protected, whether it\u2019s your laptop, phone, or tablet. Never leave your devices unattended when you are working in a cafe. Either lock it and hand over your gadgets at the reception desk or ask them to keep an eye on them when taking a restroom break. Use a padlock to lock your hostel lockers and gadget bag when using busy metros and public transportation. Never connect your devices to public WiFi, as this makes your data easily accessible to hackers. When working in or cafes, ensure you don't leave your confidential data in public view or vacate your desk without locking your laptop. If the coworking space doesn\u2019t have separate login credentials for each individual, that hides your IP address. Dress Respectfully India is a diverse country with many different cultures and customs that vary from region to region, so you will need to research . In most areas, it is appropriate to wear casual jeans and tops, but it is better to evade shoulder-revealing, knee-revealing, and body-hugging clothes to avoid unwanted attention. If you are visiting religious places, especially temples, make sure to wear a traditional dress like a salwar or saree. Western wear is much more acceptable in destinations like Goa and certain parts of Bangalore, Mumbai, and other metropolitan cities. Save Emergency Numbers Make sure to have the emergency dials saved in your phone ready to dial if you get into any undesired situations. 100: Police 1091: Women Helpline (All India) 139: Security assistance in train. If you are not in a situation to dial, send a private message to the for instant response. Helpline 112 is an app integrated with an emergency response system to address emergencies. The app requires registration along with your phone number, state, and current location and asks what kind of help is needed. Always keep someone updated about your daily travel plans so they can act promptly in emergencies. Carry a Self-Defense Tool A self-defense safety tool will give you the courage to navigate any place without feeling vulnerable about your safety. If you are a female traveling through India, a self-defense tool like pepper spray or a taser is a must, just like your phone and travel documents. But remember, a safety tool works only if you can easily access it at the right time. So if you are traveling alone in a cab at night or walking down a lonely road in an unknown place, keep your safety tool within easy reach, whether you feel threatened or not. \u200d Discover the Nurall lifestyle Latest POSTS By By",

        "markdown": "Government&Public Sector Division Public Eye On Safety Risk Assessments and Public Spaces Have you ever wondered why risk assessments are so important for public spaces? Or if they are even needed? As it turns out, the consequences of not conducting a risk assessment can be serious, from legal liabilities and reputational damage to increased risks of accidents and injuries. In this article, we will explore the importance of risk assessments for public spaces, how to conduct a risk assessment, and the benefits and consequences of doing so. Whether you are responsible for managing a public space or just want to learn more about risk management, this article is for you. Public spaces, such as city parks, recreational facilities and stadiums are places where people come together to socialize, exercise and enjoy leisure activities. While these spaces can be great sources of fun and community, they also present certain risks that must be managed to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all visitors. That is where risk assessments come in. What is a risk assessment for public spaces?

Lost and Found: A Parent\u2019s Guide to Child Safety in Public Spaces Lost and Found: A Parent\u2019s Guide to Child Safety in Public Spaces Losing your child in a public place can be a scary experience for any parent. However, knowing that your child is prepared to stay safe and quickly reunite with you can significantly shorten the time of separation. Preparing your family for these situationsis an important part of public safety for children. We have a few tips to help you get started whencoming up with a plan that works best for your family. Utilize technology: Provide your child with a means to get in contact with you, whether that is a smart watch or cell phone with your and another trusted adult\u2019s phone number programmed in. Place a tracking device in your child\u2019s pocket that you can see from your smart phone. Make sure that when using any technology for safety purposes, that your child knows how to use it, and that the battery is charged before heading out. Teach them the basics: Take time to sit down with your child and have them memorize yours and their own full name, your address, and phone number so that when they find a safe adult to help them, they can easily recite identifying information to help them reunite you. If they are too young to memorize this information, put a laminated paper with this information on them, such as in a pocket. Find a safe adult : Teach your child to look for a mom with children or a person in a uniform like a police officer, a security guard, or an employee. Show your child examples of what a uniform looks like, such as a badge or name tag by pulling up pictures on the internet or showing them real life examples. Don\u2019t go anywhere with strangers : Teach your child not to leave any public areas with anyone, such as getting in a vehicle, or going behind a closed door, and that staying where there is a lot of light is important. Remind them about what they learned when you spoke about finding a safe adult, and that a safe adult would not try to get them in a car, behind a closed door, or in a dark place. Practice what ifs and answer any questions they might have: Role play different situations with your child until they are confident with the information, and you are confident that they understand how important following the plan is. Good practice activities could include going over how to find a safe adult, reciting your contact information, or how to call you from their device. Decide Whether Your Child Should Stay Put or Go to a Pre-Determined Location: Consider whether you want your child to remain in one place or head to a specified location if they become lost. If you choose to have them stay put, ensure they understand that if they\u2019re in an area with traffic, like a parking lot, it\u2019s okay to move to a safer place while waiting. However, they should remain in a well-lit, populated area and avoid going behind closed doors or getting into strangers\u2019 cars. Instructing your child to stay in one place can help prevent them from wandering further away. This approach is usually safer and simpler for younger children. If you prefer your child to meet you at a designated location, make sure they are comfortable navigating there and that the route is easy, well-lit, and populated. Teaching them to recognize landmarks can be beneficial and encourages them to take proactive steps for their safety. This option is generally more suitable for older children who can follow directions and safely navigate public spaces. By investing time in teaching your child what to do if they get separated from you, you equip them with essential tools to stay safe and reunite with you quickly. This includes memorizing important information, understanding whether to stay put or head to a meeting point, and recognizing safe adults. Preparation is crucial. Engaging in role-play scenarios and practicing these lessons will boost your child\u2019s confidence and provide you with reassurance while in public. With a thoughtful plan tailored to your family\u2019s needs, you\u2019ll feel more at ease knowing your child is ready to handle this potentially frightening situation calmly and effectively. At The Nest Schools, we believe that safety is an important part of early childhood education and have curriculum within our Art of Living program that teaches children the fundamentals of keeping themselves safe within their environment. This includes discussions, involving them in the creation and upholding of safety guidelines, reading books that cover safety topics, and by providing and modeling real life examples of safe behavior.

By following some safety rules, outings with our children can be full of fun and trouble-free. Here are 10 helpful ways to keep kids safe in crowded public places: #1. Know your name, address, and phone number(s) We must ensure that our children know/learn our phone numbers and address just in case of any emergency. They should be able to call us anytime should they need to. #2. If you are scared, Run to safety Children must be taught to find themselves a safe spot like a crowded place or near a shop or store or any security personnel they can find in case they get lost. They must not run helter-skelter around the place. #3. It\u2019s OK to be rude to a grown-up if you feel you\u2019re unsafe. If a child feels that a stranger has approached them and the person doesn\u2019t look safe, it\u2019s okay to not speak to the stranger. The child should be taught not to entertain any conversation with a stranger. They need to hear it from you directly because this message often contradicts everything they have heard before. Learn the difference between an \u201cOK\u201d secret and a \u201cNOT OK\u201d secret A child must be taught not to keep any secret from his/her parents. He/she must be cautioned to beware of an adult that asks the child to keep a secret from parents. That definitely is a dangerous sign. secret and a \u201cNOT OK\u201d secret #5. Find Designated Place To Meet In case you are visiting a mall or a park with the child, make sure you designate a common place where you all can meet in case anyone gets lost. It could be near the security desk, food court or a store. Stay there until you are found. #6. Never take shortcuts A child must be taught never to take shortcuts, roads that are not often taken by people. They should be guided that it\u2019s fine to reach a little late rather than taking some unusual route. #7. Shout for help In case of danger, or even you feel the environment around you little suspicious scream your lungs out. Shout for help. It doesn\u2019t matter if you gather a crowd. Safety is the most important. #8. Listen to your instincts Tell your parents or a trusted adult if someone is asking you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Listen to your instincts. If a situation or a person just doesn\u2019t seem safe, your child\u2019s gut instinct should kick in. Teach your kids to listen to that little voice inside of them that alerts them to the potential danger of a situation or a suspicious individual. If their instincts tell them that a situation is potentially dangerous, they should run away and find an authority figure that they can trust. #9. Make Kids ask for Permission It\u2019s important to explain to kids of all ages that they need to ask you for permission before they go off anywhere. In crowded places, they should always let an adult know before they go off to another area. #10. Explain Stranger Danger to Your Kids From the time that your children are old enough to understand, you want to talk to them about the dangers of going off with a stranger.

Learn the difference between an \u201cOK\u201d secret and a \u201cNOT OK\u201d secret A child must be taught not to keep any secret from his/her parents. He/she must be cautioned to beware of an adult that asks the child to keep a secret from parents. That definitely is a dangerous sign. secret and a \u201cNOT OK\u201d secret #5.

Never take shortcuts A child must be taught never to take shortcuts, roads that are not often taken by people.

Public security is an important concern, and crime prevention measures play a significant role in safeguarding teenagers in these environments. Here are some practical tips and essential safety measures to keep in mind: Stay alert: Encourage your teen to stay attentive and aware of their surroundings. Being aware of who is around them can help them spot any potential dangers. Avoid shortcuts through alleyways: Advise your teen to take well-lit and busy routes instead of secluded shortcuts to minimize their vulnerability to potential threats. Cross the road or go to a busy area if someone is following them: If your teen feels someone is following them, they should head towards a crowded area or cross the road to create distance and seek help if necessary. Carry a whistle or alarm: A whistle or personal alarm can be a valuable tool for drawing attention and deterring potential attackers. Use bus stops on busy roads: Encourage your teen to wait for buses at stops located on busy roads with good lighting and visibility. Keep valuables out of sight: Teach your teen to keep valuable belongings, such as smartphones and jewelry, hidden from plain view to minimize the risk of theft or attracting unwanted attention. Avoid carrying weapons: Emphasize the importance of avoiding carrying any weapons as they can escalate a situation and potentially put your teen in danger. Speak up if being bullied or in danger: Encourage your teen to speak up and seek assistance if they encounter bullying or feel threatened in any way. By implementing these safety measures, teens can be better prepared to navigate public spaces confidently while reducing the risks they may face. Preparing Children for Crowded Places Proper preparation can go a long way in ensuring the safety of children in crowded public places. Whether you\u2019re heading to a theme park, shopping mall, or a busy city street, taking certain precautions can help keep your child safe and give you peace of mind. Here are some tips to help you prepare your child for navigating through crowded areas: Designate meeting points: Before entering a crowded place, establish a specific spot where your child can go if they get separated from you. This can be a recognizable landmark or a designated area near an information booth. Hold hands: Encourage your child to always hold hands with an adult or an older sibling while navigating through crowded areas. This simple act can prevent them from getting lost or accidentally wandering off. Trust their instincts: Teach your child to trust their instincts and speak up if they feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Encourage them to let you know if someone or something seems suspicious, so you can take appropriate action. It\u2019s also important to ensure that everyone in your family has a cell phone with fully charged batteries. In case of separation, having a way to communicate with each other can help quickly reunite. Consider using a family tracker app to monitor your child\u2019s location, providing an added layer of safety and peace of mind. Remember to explain the concept of stranger danger to your child and emphasize the importance of not going off with strangers. Give your child an ID tag with contact information that they can wear discreetly, providing a way for others to contact you in case they get lost. For younger children, remind them to avoid talking to strangers, walk away with them, and keep the location of any approaches a secret. Lastly, it\u2019s essential to have a conversation about safety with your family before heading out to crowded places. Teach your child to ask for permission before going anywhere or accepting anything from strangers. By instilling these safety measures and practicing them regularly, you can help ensure the well-being of your child in any crowded public environment. Holding Hands and Other Safety Measures Incorporating simple safety measures, such as holding hands and utilizing modern technology, can significantly enhance your child\u2019s safety in public places . When venturing into crowded areas, it\u2019s essential to designate a meet-up location if you and your child get separated. This way, you can quickly reunite and minimize anxiety. Encouraging your child to hold hands with an adult or a sibling provides an extra layer of security. By maintaining physical contact, you can ensure their proximity and promptly respond to any potential dangers. Teaching kids to trust their instincts is equally important. Instill in them the confidence to recognize uncomfortable situations and take appropriate action. Modern technology can be a valuable tool in ensuring your child\u2019s safety. Equip everyone with a cell phone with fully charged batteries and consider using a family tracker app to monitor their whereabouts. These apps can provide peace of mind and allow you to track their location in busy environments. In addition to these measures, educating your child about stranger danger is crucial. Teach them the importance of not going off with strangers and provide practical advice on recognizing potential dangers. Giving your child an ID tag with contact information can also be helpful in case they get lost. Remember that preparation is key. Before heading out, talk to your family about safety and discuss the necessary guidelines. Reinforce the importance of following rules, asking for permission before going anywhere, and sticking together as a unit. For younger children, emphasize the significance of avoiding conversations with strangers, walking away with them, and keeping any approaches from strangers a secret. Teenagers should be aware of their surroundings, avoid isolated areas, and take proactive steps to protect themselves if they feel threatened. By incorporating these safety measures, you can foster a secure environment for your child in public places. Always hold their hand, designate meet-up points, seat them on a cart in supermarkets, and consistently reinforce the importance of avoiding strangers. With your guidance, they will develop the necessary skills to navigate crowded areas and stay safe. FAQ Q: What are some tips for keeping children safe in crowded areas?

These include the crowded Rajiv Chowk,  Barakhamba Road, Mandi House, R.K. Ashram Marg, Jhandewalan and Karol  Bagh Metro stations. Listen to Story Advertisement According to a Delhi Police survey, premises of 44 of the 125 Metro stations in the Capital lack proper lighting arrangements. New Delhi,UPDATED:Apr 22, 2015 11:09 IST According to a Delhi Police survey, premises of 44 of the 125 Metro stations in the Capital lack proper lighting arrangements. If you believe premises of the Delhi Metro stations are one of the safest places in the city, it's time to rethink. Nearly one-third of the Metro stations have been found \"unsafe\", particularly for women, by the Delhi Police. In a survey conducted to assess the status of lighting arrangements in Metro parking lots and on roads leading to the stations, the Delhi Police has found that 44 of the 125 Metro stations in the national Capital have inadequate lighting. advertisement Delhi Police officials said that nearly 500 cases of snatchings and over 2,000 cases of stalking were reported, from outside these stations, in 2014. The survey report states that parking lots at almost all Metro stations in and around Connaught Place are poorly-lit though the roads leading to them have adequate lighting. These include the crowded Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba Road, Mandi House, R.K. Ashram Marg, Jhandewalan and Karol Bagh Metro stations. Similarly, the parking lot at Patel Chowk Metro station, which is located close to the Parliament House and the Parliament Street police station, has been found unsafe for women commuters. The parking lot at the station has inadequate lighting, which makes it prone to petty crimes. A police official said the survey was conducted following frequent complaints of snatching and stalking from outside several Metro stations. advertisement The survey, conducted in every police district, has revealed that none of the Metro stations in East District-including Laxmi Nagar, Yamuna Bank, Preet Vihar and Nirman Vihar-has properly-lit parking lots or approach roads. Surprisingly, the Metro stations at Akshardham and Anand Vihar too lack proper lighting arrangements. Notably, these two stations receive high footfall as tourists and rail passengers use this station in large numbers. In North-West Delhi, Jahangir Puri and Netaji Subhash Place Metros stations are most unsafe for women commuters. In Central and North Delhi, Shadipur and Pul Bangush top the list of unsafe stations while areas surrounding Uttam Nagar, Panjabi Bagh, Janakpuri, Pashchim Vihar and Moti Nagar Metro stations in West Delhi too lack properly-lit roads and parking lots. All 10 Metro stations in Dwarka are vulnerable for women commuters during night hours, the report adds. \"As the approach roads are poorly lit, the streets surrounding such stations are occupied by anti-social elements. Thus, posing risk to commuters. The matter, however, has been taken up with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC),\" said a police officer. The Delhi Metro, on its behalf, has said it would look into the matter and make necessary arrangements. \"Wherever possible, we will make the best efforts to improve the safety of our passengers. All Metro station premises will be provided with adequate lighting,\" DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said. He, however, clarified that the parking lots at Rajiv Chowk and Barakhamba Road Metro stations are not operated by the Delhi Metro. Published By: AtMigration Published On: Feb 14, 2015 --- ENDS ---",

One crucial aspect that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked during the journey is safety. This guide highlights the top safety tips for women in trains so as to ensure a comfortable and stress-free train journey for them. As you plan your travel, do not underestimate the heavy crowds and the long travel hours as they could lead to a challenge for you. To travel confidently and securely, you can follow the below safety tips and get your on time through a recognized platform, like EaseMyTrip. 1. Book Your Ticket in Advance The first step to ensuring a safe journey is to book your train ticket in advance, especially during the holiday season when trains are usually fully booked. Opt for upper berths, as they offer more privacy and security, particularly on overnight journeys. Always choose an official travel platform or a trusted travel agent to book your tickets, ensuring you are on a confirmed reservation. 2. Avoid Nighttime Arrivals at Unfamiliar Stations Arriving at unfamiliar destinations late at night can make any traveller, particularly women, feel vulnerable. If possible, choose train schedules that have you arriving during the daytime when the station is bustling with activity. If a nighttime arrival is unavoidable, arrange for a trusted pickup service in advance or wait in well-lit, busy areas of the station until help arrives. 3. Stay Aware of Your Surroundings One of the best safety measures is staying alert throughout your journey. Observe the people around you and be aware of your surroundings at all times. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable or you notice any suspicious activity, don\u2019t hesitate to inform the railway police or onboard staff. Keeping your wits about you can help you avoid any potential threats or inconveniences. 4. Secure Your Belongings The peak season often brings crowds to trains, and with that comes the increased risk of theft. Always keep your luggage close and securely locked. Invest in a good-quality travel lock for your bags and use chains to secure them to your seat or berth. Additionally, carry your valuables like mobile phones, wallets, and important documents in a small pouch or crossbody bag that remains on you at all times. 5. Share Your Travel Details with Family or Friends Before embarking on your journey, share your train number, seat details, and expected time of arrival with a trusted family member or friend. Regularly check in with them during your trip, especially if your train is delayed. Having someone who knows your whereabouts provides extra peace of mind and a point of contact in case of emergencies. Suggested Read: 6. Carry Basic Safety Tools It\u2019s wise to carry a few basic safety tools while travelling on trains. A small pocket-sized pepper spray, a whistle, or even a flashlight can come in handy in uncomfortable situations. While you may never have to use them, having these tools within reach will boost your confidence during the journey. 7. Avoid Sharing Personal Information with Strangers It\u2019s natural to strike up conversations with fellow passengers, but avoid sharing personal information such as your travel plans, accommodation details, or your home address. Engaging in casual conversations is fine, but always keep your private information to yourself. You never know who could misuse the details you disclose. 8. Trust Your Instincts Finally, one of the most important safety tips is to trust your instincts. If you ever feel uneasy or unsafe during your journey, don\u2019t hesitate to act on those feelings. Move to a different coach, inform the train staff, or ask for help from other passengers if needed. Your intuition is one of your best tools for staying safe. 9. Keep Important Documents and Tickets Easily Accessible It\u2019s crucial to keep your train tickets, ID proof, and other important documents in an easily accessible yet secure place during your journey. Use a small pouch or a travel wallet to store these items and keep them within reach, like in your handbag or a secure pocket. This allows you to quickly access them when needed without rummaging through your luggage, and it minimises the risk of losing essential documents. Having your documents ready can also reduce stress when asked to show them by authorities or train staff. Also, do not forget to of your train to ensure a smooth and hassle-free odyssey. 10. Keep Emergency Contacts Handy Before boarding the train, make sure you have a list of emergency contacts saved on your phone, including local police, railway authorities, and trusted friends or family. Additionally, download any safety apps that provide quick access to emergency services. If you encounter any uncomfortable situation, having these contacts easily accessible can provide immediate help and assistance. The Bottom Line! In a nutshell, travelling by train during the holiday season can be an exciting experience, but it\u2019s essential to prioritise your safety, especially for women travelling alone. By booking tickets in advance, staying alert, securing your belongings, and being mindful of your interactions, you can ensure a smooth and worry-free journey. Whether you\u2019re heading home or embarking on a new adventure, these safety tips for women in trains will help you stay safe and enjoy your journey to the fullest. So, pack your bags, follow these safety measures, and have a wonderful and secure train journey this holiday season!

One crucial aspect that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked during the journey is safety. This guide highlights the top safety tips for women in trains so as to ensure a comfortable and stress-free train journey for them. As you plan your travel, do not underestimate the heavy crowds and the long travel hours as they could lead to a challenge for you. To travel confidently and securely, you can follow the below safety tips and get your on time through a recognized platform, like EaseMyTrip. The first step to ensuring a safe journey is to book your train ticket in advance, especially during the holiday season when trains are usually fully booked. Opt for upper berths, as they offer more privacy and security, particularly on overnight journeys. Always choose an official travel platform or a trusted travel agent to book your tickets, ensuring you are on a confirmed reservation. Arriving at unfamiliar destinations late at night can make any traveller, particularly women, feel vulnerable. If possible, choose train schedules that have you arriving during the daytime when the station is bustling with activity. If a nighttime arrival is unavoidable, arrange for a trusted pickup service in advance or wait in well-lit, busy areas of the station until help arrives. One of the best safety measures is staying alert throughout your journey. Observe the people around you and be aware of your surroundings at all times. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable or you notice any suspicious activity, don\u2019t hesitate to inform the railway police or onboard staff. Keeping your wits about you can help you avoid any potential threats or inconveniences. The peak season often brings crowds to trains, and with that comes the increased risk of theft. Always keep your luggage close and securely locked. Invest in a good-quality travel lock for your bags and use chains to secure them to your seat or berth. Additionally, carry your valuables like mobile phones, wallets, and important documents in a small pouch or crossbody bag that remains on you at all times. Before embarking on your journey, share your train number, seat details, and expected time of arrival with a trusted family member or friend. Regularly check in with them during your trip, especially if your train is delayed. Having someone who knows your whereabouts provides extra peace of mind and a point of contact in case of emergencies. Suggested Read: It\u2019s wise to carry a few basic safety tools while travelling on trains. A small pocket-sized pepper spray, a whistle, or even a flashlight can come in handy in uncomfortable situations. While you may never have to use them, having these tools within reach will boost your confidence during the journey. It\u2019s natural to strike up conversations with fellow passengers, but avoid sharing personal information such as your travel plans, accommodation details, or your home address. Engaging in casual conversations is fine, but always keep your private information to yourself. You never know who could misuse the details you disclose. Finally, one of the most important safety tips is to trust your instincts. If you ever feel uneasy or unsafe during your journey, don\u2019t hesitate to act on those feelings. Move to a different coach, inform the train staff, or ask for help from other passengers if needed. Your intuition is one of your best tools for staying safe. It\u2019s crucial to keep your train tickets, ID proof, and other important documents in an easily accessible yet secure place during your journey. Use a small pouch or a travel wallet to store these items and keep them within reach, like in your handbag or a secure pocket. This allows you to quickly access them when needed without rummaging through your luggage, and it minimises the risk of losing essential documents. Having your documents ready can also reduce stress when asked to show them by authorities or train staff. Also, do not forget to of your train to ensure a smooth and hassle-free odyssey. Before boarding the train, make sure you have a list of emergency contacts saved on your phone, including local police, railway authorities, and trusted friends or family. Additionally, download any safety apps that provide quick access to emergency services. If you encounter any uncomfortable situation, having these contacts easily accessible can provide immediate help and assistance. The Bottom Line! In a nutshell, travelling by train during the holiday season can be an exciting experience, but it\u2019s essential to prioritise your safety, especially for women travelling alone. By booking tickets in advance, staying alert, securing your belongings, and being mindful of your interactions, you can ensure a smooth and worry-free journey. Whether you\u2019re heading home or embarking on a new adventure, these safety tips for women in trains will help you stay safe and enjoy your journey to the fullest. So, pack your bags, follow these safety measures, and have a wonderful and secure train journey this holiday season!

        "markdown": "Edit Content Menu Edit Content Menu When was the last time you felt the wind in your hair, your heart beating, and that rush of joy that caused you to shout aloud? If you are planning a trip to an amusement park, you are in for a great journey! Amusement park rides can be a fantastic experience, but safety should always come first. Here are some basic safety recommendations to help you make the most of your experience and stay safe while enjoying the rides. 1. Check The Safety instructions carefully Before you hop onto any ride, make sure to read the amusement park rides safety instructions posted at the entrance. These instructions are there for your protection. Pay attention to any warnings, like height, weight, or health restrictions. If a ride operator provides instructions, listen carefully and follow them exactly. These instructions are based on years of testing and experience to keep everyone safe. 2. Follow The Safety Rules Once you\u2019re on the amusement park rides, always remain seated until it comes to a complete stop. Use all safety restraints, such as seat belts, harnesses, and lap bars. These are designed to keep you securely in place. Avoid the temptation to stand up, lean out, or loosen any restraints during the ride. Remember, they are there to protect you from unexpected movements, sharp turns, and fast speeds! 3. Keep Your Hands, Arms, and Legs Inside It might seem fun to raise your arms or legs during an amusement park rides, especially when the thrill kicks in, but keeping them inside the ride vehicle is important. Extending your arms or legs could lead to injuries if they come into contact with objects or other parts of the ride. Keeping your limbs inside the ride vehicle helps ensure your safety throughout the experience. 4. Know What To Do Some of the amusement park rides can be intense, with high speeds, steep drops, or spinning motions. If you feel uncomfortable with any ride, saying no is okay. Know your limits, especially if you have any medical conditions like heart problems, neck or back issues, or if you\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s better to enjoy the day with a smile rather than push yourself into something that might be unsafe for you. 5. Secure Loose Items Before boarding any of the amusement park rides, make sure to secure loose items like hats, sunglasses, dupattas, sarees, phones, or jewelry. Rides can have sudden movements that may cause these items to fall or become lost. Some rides even provide storage areas where you can safely keep your belongings. Keeping your hands free and loose items stored away will help you enjoy the ride without worrying about losing something valuable. 6. Take Break and Drink Water Often Amusement park rides are filled with excitement, and it\u2019s easy to lose track of time. But with all the walking, standing in lines, and the thrill of rides, your body needs to stay hydrated. Carry a water bottle and drink regularly, especially if you\u2019re visiting during a hot day. Also, take short breaks between rides to rest and recharge. This will help prevent fatigue and ensure you stay in good shape throughout the day. 7. Don\u2019t Forget To Check With Children If you\u2019re visiting with children, make sure they are always within your sight. Explain safety rules in a way they can understand and ensure they follow them. Make sure they meet the height and age requirements for each of the amusement park rides. Hold their hands when walking through crowded areas, and remind them not to run or push while waiting in lines. Safety is even more important for our little ones, so keep a close watch. 8. Follow Ride Exit Procedures When the amusement park rides end, don\u2019t rush to get off. Wait until the operator gives you the signal to exit, and follow the instructions carefully. Rushing or trying to exit before it\u2019s safe can lead to accidents. Be mindful of your surroundings and exit the ride area calmly and safely. 9. Plan for Emergencies It\u2019s a good idea to be prepared for any emergencies. Make sure you know where the first aid stations are located. If you or someone in your group feels unwell, seek help immediately. Keep a charged phone with you and make sure everyone in your group knows a common meeting point in case someone gets separated.

Watch on 0:00 /\n\u2022Live \u2022 Here are some more tips to help you stay safe at the movie theatre: Be vigilant & practice good situational awareness Prepare for emergencies Keep your cell phone handy Park in a well-lit parking lot Let your family and friends know where you are Avoid midnight showings Be Vigilant and Practice Good Situational Awareness We\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019re going to say it again. Situational awareness is the single most important thing you can do to stay safe and reduce the chances of finding yourself in a threatening situation. Be aware of your surroundings: pay attention to who is sitting around you and what\u2019s going on in the aisleways. If you see something suspicious, report it to security immediately. If something or someone makes you uncomfortable remove yourself from the situation. Arrive early: arriving before the lights have dimmed gives you the ability to look around and identify any potential threats. You should also use this time to locate the exits, both in the theatre itself, and the building in general. Keep your belongings close: never put your purse or other valuables on the floor or under your seat. Always keep them by your side or on your lap. It only takes a thief a few seconds to grab your bag and run \u2013 often without you knowing. Trust your instincts: if something doesn\u2019t feel right, listen to your gut and leave the theatre Prepare for Emergencies Although it\u2019s something we don\u2019t want to think about, preparing and planning for the possibility of finding yourself in an emergency situation is an important step in keeping yourself safe and avoiding harm. Take a few moments to plan out different scenarios and the actions you would take in the event an emergency was to happen. It\u2019s a lot easier to plan in advance than try to wing it in the midst of adrenaline and fear. When you arrive at the movie theatre, look around and identify the nearest exits or places you would hide in the event you aren\u2019t able to reach the exits safely. If you are with your family or friends, establish an emergency meeting place in the event you get separated and make sure your children know how to reach you if it becomes necessary. Keep Your Cell Phone Handy We\u2019ve probably all heard the announcement \u2013 \u201ccell phone usage is not allowed. Please put away your cell phones during the movie.\u201d Just because they say cell phones aren\u2019t allowed doesn\u2019t mean you have to tuck them away in your purse or bag. Putting your cell phone on silent or vibrate and keeping it handy means it will be easier to call someone in the event of an emergency or in the event someone needs to reach you. Park in a Well-Lit Area Parking lots, particularly at night, are a hotbed for criminal activity. When you go to the movies, make sure you park in a well-lit area preferably close to the movie theatre entrance. A well-lit parking area will also help you see your surroundings and assess if there are any potential threats. Never unlock your doors until you are sure that there are no threats. 10% of all violent crimes occur in parking lots and garages at night. This is because it is easy to surprise someone and get away without being seen or caught. Find more safety tips in our article on parking garage safety. Let Your Family and Friends Know Particularly if you\u2019re going alone, it is important to let your family or friends know where you\u2019re going to be and what time to expect you home. Consider setting up a safety word with your family and friends, allowing you to easily text or call with a single word meaning to send help immediately.\u00a0Many people choose to use their phone to share their location, even temporarily, as a precaution. Avoid Midnight Showings Midnight showings can be a lot of fun particularly if you and your friends have been waiting for what seems like decades for the next installment of your favorite movie series to come out \u2013 you know who you are! However, it is important to be aware of the dangers that come with them. Most criminal activity happens at night when it\u2019s dark and easy to get away. These midnight showings also generate larger, more excitable crowds. As is always the case, make sure you are familiar with your surroundings and the potential threats around you.

Situational awareness is the single most important thing you can do to stay safe and reduce the chances of finding yourself in a threatening situation. Be aware of your surroundings: pay attention to who is sitting around you and what\u2019s going on in the aisleways. If you see something suspicious, report it to security immediately. If something or someone makes you uncomfortable remove yourself from the situation. Arrive early: arriving before the lights have dimmed gives you the ability to look around and identify any potential threats. You should also use this time to locate the exits, both in the theatre itself, and the building in general. Keep your belongings close: never put your purse or other valuables on the floor or under your seat. Always keep them by your side or on your lap. It only takes a thief a few seconds to grab your bag and run \u2013 often without you knowing. Trust your instincts: if something doesn\u2019t feel right, listen to your gut and leave the theatre Prepare for Emergencies Although it\u2019s something we don\u2019t want to think about, preparing and planning for the possibility of finding yourself in an emergency situation is an important step in keeping yourself safe and avoiding harm. Take a few moments to plan out different scenarios and the actions you would take in the event an emergency was to happen. It\u2019s a lot easier to plan in advance than try to wing it in the midst of adrenaline and fear. When you arrive at the movie theatre, look around and identify the nearest exits or places you would hide in the event you aren\u2019t able to reach the exits safely. If you are with your family or friends, establish an emergency meeting place in the event you get separated and make sure your children know how to reach you if it becomes necessary. Keep Your Cell Phone Handy We\u2019ve probably all heard the announcement \u2013 \u201ccell phone usage is not allowed. Please put away your cell phones during the movie.\u201d Just because they say cell phones aren\u2019t allowed doesn\u2019t mean you have to tuck them away in your purse or bag. Putting your cell phone on silent or vibrate and keeping it handy means it will be easier to call someone in the event of an emergency or in the event someone needs to reach you. Park in a Well-Lit Area Parking lots, particularly at night, are a hotbed for criminal activity. When you go to the movies, make sure you park in a well-lit area preferably close to the movie theatre entrance. A well-lit parking area will also help you see your surroundings and assess if there are any potential threats. Never unlock your doors until you are sure that there are no threats. 10% of all violent crimes occur in parking lots and garages at night. This is because it is easy to surprise someone and get away without being seen or caught. Find more safety tips in our article on parking garage safety. Let Your Family and Friends Know Particularly if you\u2019re going alone, it is important to let your family or friends know where you\u2019re going to be and what time to expect you home. Consider setting up a safety word with your family and friends, allowing you to easily text or call with a single word meaning to send help immediately.\u00a0Many people choose to use their phone to share their location, even temporarily, as a precaution. Avoid Midnight Showings Midnight showings can be a lot of fun particularly if you and your friends have been waiting for what seems like decades for the next installment of your favorite movie series to come out \u2013 you know who you are! However, it is important to be aware of the dangers that come with them. Most criminal activity happens at night when it\u2019s dark and easy to get away. These midnight showings also generate larger, more excitable crowds. As is always the case, make sure you are familiar with your surroundings and the potential threats around you. If you are really set on going to a midnight showing, make sure you\u2019re in a group and not alone. Consider Personal Protection Gear Personal protection gear, like our Everyday Armor T-Shirt or bulletproof backpack inserts, are becoming more and more common these days.

Wear your bag across your body so it is more difficult to snatch Tuck your purse under your arm or hold it close with both hands Keep\u00a0sight of your purse at all times and never leave it unattended in a shopping cart or on the ground Consider using a smaller bag or purse making it easier to keep close When talking with our own employees at Premier Body Armor, Sullivan, Social\u00a0Marketing Specialist, said her biggest tip was to keep her dominant arm free when she is carrying things around the store and to her car. Consider Personal Protection While not everyone chooses to carry a concealed weapon, there are a number of different personal protection equipment options that are available. Consider carrying pepper spray in your bag, or a personal alarm, which will alert anyone in the area that you need help. It has also become more and more common for people to wear or carry body armor or bulletproof inserts.
